* Issues with refreshing dependencies in Eclipse

If there is trouble refreshing the dependencies in Eclipse after making changes to the build.gradle file, follow the steps below:

1. check if you have included eclipse gradle plugin. `apply plugin : 'eclipse'`
1. Go to your project terminal
1. Run `gradle tasks --all` to see the list of all available gradle tasks.
1. If the task `cleanEclipse` is available, run it.
1. If not, run `gradle cleanEclipseProject` and `gradle cleanEclipseClasspath` separately.
1. After that, run `gradle eclipse`
1. Go to the project in eclipse and refresh the project.

This should bring all the latest dependencies down and you should see them in the `Referenced Libraries` section.

* Helpful Gradle commands

*** List all tasks

To look at all the available tasks for a gradle project, use this: 

#+begin_src 
gradlew tasks --all  
#+end_src

*** Publish to maven local

`gradlew publishToMavenLocal`

*** Working with EAR projects

Go to the EAR folder in command prompt:

    #+begin_src 
    C:\XXXXXXXXXXXXXEAR
    #+end_src

And use this command to build EAR.

    #+begin_src 
    gradle clean ear --info
    gradle clean testall --info
    gradle clean testAll ear â€“-info
    #+end_src

From folder :      ~C:\XXXXXXXXXXEAR\build\distributions~
To folder :        ~C:\WASLP_dev\tools\WASLP8559\wlp\usr\servers\default\dropins~

Windows command to copy the EAR from a source folder to a destination folder:
    #+begin_src 
    xcopy C:\XXXXXXXXXXXXXXEAR\build\distributions C:\WASLP_dev\tools\WASLP8559\wlp\usr\servers\default\dropins
    #+end_src

    #+end_src

* How to exclude a few tasks from the Gradle build process :
