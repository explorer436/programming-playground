Hi there,

Thanks for signing up to Daily Coding Problem! I hope you enjoy the problems we send.

I'd like to take just a few moments to share with you what to expect from Daily Coding Problem, and offer a few suggestions for how you can make the most of it.

We'll be sending you one programming interview question every day that was asked recently by top tech companies. Each question should take under one hour to solve, including actual working code and some tests. Here are a few suggestions to get the most out of the problems:

    Actually do the problems. This means writing the code and making it run. Getting stuck can be frustrating, but it's natural and the best way to learn.
    Time yourself. Candidates who solve interview problems quickly are more likely to cinch the interview.
    Think of edge cases and run your code through them. Some good edge cases might be the empty case, weird inputs, or a really large input.
    Once you've made sure your code passes all your tests, try explaining your algorithm to a colleague or friend.
    You could also start a mini-discussion group with your friends to discuss each day's problem.
    Forward a problem to people you think might enjoy it, and discuss potential solutions with them.

Finally, feel free to send us any feedback or suggestions! You can email us anytime at this email. Also, let us know if Daily Coding Problem helped you out in any way â€” we'd love to hear about it.

We will send your first problem at 9:00AM PST. Best,

Marc
