* Displaying available Maven dependency updates:

  To simply know if and how we can update our project, the right tool for the job is this command:
  #+begin_src 
  mvn versions:display-dependency-updates  
  #+end_src
  
  This command checks and shows if there are updates to the versions of the dependencies.
