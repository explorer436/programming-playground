Runnable interface is implemented by the Thread class.
A common protocol for all the objects that wish to execute in a different thread (than the calling thread) is to extend Runnable interface.
It is one of the ways of creating threads in Java.

The other way to create a thread is by subclassing the Thread class. A class implementing Runnable interface can simply pass itself to create a Thread instance and can run thereafter. This eliminates the need of subclassing the Thread class for the purpose of executing the code in a separate thread.
