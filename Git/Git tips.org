*** Checking out branches

| command                                                          | description                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| git checkout -b feature/testFeatureBranch                        | Same step as above; But you don't have to mention develop branch in the command if you are already on the develop branch |
| git checkout localBranch1                                        | To find out which remote branch your local branch is tracking                                                            |

*** Checking status and differences for files

| command                         | description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| git diff filename.txt           | command to show changes in a specific file. command to see what you haven't "git add"ed yet                                                                                                              |
| git diff --word-diff myfile.txt | Instead of showing you two lines for each change, Git allows you to highlight changes in a line explicitly. (The result is usually colored nicely, the removed part being red and the added text green.) |
| git diff --cached myfile.txt    | command to see already "-add" ed changes                                                                                                                                                                 |

*** How to see the file differences between a local branch and a remote branch

    Needless to say, before doing this, fetch all the updates from the remote first.

    #+begin_src 
    git diff <local branch> <remote branch>
    #+end_src

*** Staging changes

| command                        | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| git commit -m "commit message" | To commit with a custom message                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| git stash -u                   | command to undo all changes                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| GIT LOG --ONELINE              | To view recent commit messages                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| git push                       | To push the commits to an upsteam remote branch                                                                                                                                                                                      |

When doing a diff on a long line, this can be very helpful but you'll still get a less-like scrolling output that can be unhandy to use. You maybe just want the diff put into your terminal:

#+begin_src 
  `PAGER='' git diff --word-diff myfile.txt`  
#+end_src

*** Reversing changes in Git

There are two primary ways to undo changes in Git -- one is using ~git reset~ and the other is using ~git revert~.

This would result in the following:
Git moves the main branch reference back to ~C1~; now our local repository is in a state as if ~C2~ had never happened.

This would result in the following:

*** Moving Work Around in Git.

~git cherry-pick~ will plop down a commit from anywhere in the tree onto HEAD (as long as that commit isn't an ancestor of HEAD).

#+begin_src 
git cherry-pick <Commit1> <Commit2> <...>
#+end_src

It's a very straightforward way of saying that you would like to copy a series of commits below your current location (HEAD).

[[./images/21.png]]

This would result in:

[[./images/22.png]]

*** See all Unpushed commits or commits that are not in another branch.

| git cherry -v                   | If you need to find out which of your local commits are not on the remote server do this. The -v option prints out the commit messages. Without it you will see only the SHA1 codes.                   |
| git cherry -v origin/somebranch | You may also compare against another (upstream) branch like that. This tool is especially useful when you have a ton of commits after a merge and want to know the commit differences between branches |
| git show (COMMIT_HASH)          | Once you have the list from the command above, use this to see the files that changed in each commit                                                                                                   |

*** Remove all your local branches except master

    Sometimes, you may want to delete all your local branches except master

    #+begin_src 
    git branch | grep -ve " master$" | xargs git branch -D
    #+end_src

    You can also use an alias:

    #+begin_src 
    alias gbr="git branch | grep -ve " master$" | xargs git branch -D"
    #+end_src

*** Clean-up

** Undoing a git push

Before you undo a push, you need to make sure that no other users of this repository are fetching the incorrect changes or trying to build on top of the commits that you want removed because you are about to rewind history.

When you need to 'force' push the old reference.

#+begin_src 
git push -f origin last_known_good_commit:branch_name~
#+end_src

e.g.

#+begin_src 
git push -f origin cc4b63bebb6:alpha-0.3.0~
#+end_src

** Remove last commit from remote git repository

Be careful before you do this because this will create an "alternate reality" for people who have already fetch/pulled/cloned from the remote repository.
But in fact, it's quite simple:

#+begin_src 
git reset HEAD^ * remove commit locally
git push origin +HEAD * force-push the new HEAD commit  
#+end_src

If you want to still have it in your local repository and only remove it from the remote, then you can use:
#+begin_src 
git push origin +HEAD^:<name of your branch, most likely 'master'>  
#+end_src

** Undo a commit and redo

#+begin_src 
 git commit -m "Something terribly misguided"              (1)

 git reset HEAD~                                           (2)

< edit files as necessary >>                               (3)

 git add ...                                               (4)

 git commit -c ORIG_HEAD                                   (5)  
#+end_src

1. This is what you want to undo
1. This leaves your working tree (the state of your files on disk) unchanged but undoes the commit and leaves the changes you  committed unstaged (so they'll appear as "Changes not staged for commit" in git status, and you'll need to add them again before committing). If you only want to add more changes to the previous commit, or change the commit message1, you could use git reset --soft HEAD~ instead, which is like git reset HEAD~ (where HEAD~ is the same as HEAD~1) but leaves your existing changes staged.
1. Make corrections to working tree files.
1. git add anything that you want to include in your new commit.
1. Commit the changes, reusing the old commit message. reset copied the old head to .git/ORIG_HEAD; commit with -c ORIG_HEAD will open an editor, which initially contains the log message from the old commit and allows you to edit it. If you do not need to edit the message, you could use the -C option.

If the commit you want to fix isn’t the most recent one:

#+begin_src 
  git rebase --interactive $parent_of_flawed_commit (after the git log command, if you want to edit the fifth commit, then enter the name of the sixth commit in this command.)  
#+end_src

If you want to fix several flawed commits, pass the parent of the oldest one of them.

#+begin_src 
  An editor will come up, with a list of all commits since the one you gave.
  Change pick to reword (or on old versions of Git, to edit) in front of any commits you want to fix.
  Once you save, Git will replay the listed commits.  
#+end_src

For each commit you want to reword, Git will drop you back into your editor. For each commit you want to edit, Git drops you into the shell. If you’re in the shell:

#+begin_src 
  Change the commit in any way you like.
  git commit --amend
  git rebase --continue  
#+end_src

Most of this sequence will be explained to you by the output of the various commands as you go. It’s very easy, you don’t need to memorise it – just remember that git rebase --interactive lets you correct commits no matter how long ago they were.
