    Generalized Fibonacci selector
    Write a function that can select the first N terms of the Fibonacci series that match a given condition. Take note:
    
    The result of the function itself should contain N terms, 
    i.e. if the first 3 even terms are requested, the result should be: [2, 8, 34]. 
    Similarly, if the first two multiples-of-3 are requested, the result should be: [3, 21]
    You should consider writing your own higher-order function (write a function that accepts the condition as a lambda)
