Installing Haskell

There are currently four ways to install Haskell! Here’s what they are:

Via your OS’ native package manager, i.e. apt-get, or homebrew, or yum
Via a minimal installer or the Haskell Platform
Via Stack - https://haskell-lang.org/get-started (recommended)
Via Nix/NixOS

Recommendation
Out of the four methods listed above, only Stack is recommended for maintaining your sanity. 
So, head over to Stack’s Get Started page and follow only the first step, titled “Download Haskell Stack” for your OS. 
The other steps given on that page are covered in greater detail below.
