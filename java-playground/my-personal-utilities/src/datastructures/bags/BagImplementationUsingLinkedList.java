/**
 * 
	Implementing our Bag API using a linked-list data structure is
	simply a matter of changing the name of push() in Stack to add() and removing the
	implementation of pop() , as shown in the algorithm below (doing the
	same for Queue would also be effective but requires a bit more code). 
	
	This implementation also highlights the code needed to make Stack , Queue , and Bag all iterable, by
	traversing the list. For Stack the list is in LIFO order; for Queue it is in FIFO order; and
	for Bag it happens to be in LIFO order, but the order is not relevant. 
	
	To implement iteration in a collection, the first step is to include
		import java.util.Iterator;
	so that our code can refer to Javaâ€™s Iterator interface. 
	The second step is to add implements Iterable<Item> to the class declaration, 
	a promise to provide an iterator() method. The iterator()
	method itself simply returns an object from a class that implements the Iterator
	interface:
		public Iterator<Item> iterator()
		{
			return new ListIterator();
		}
	This code is a promise to implement a class that implements the hasNext() , next() ,
	and remove() methods that are called when a client uses the foreach construct. To
	implement these methods, the nested class ListIterator in this Algorithm maintains
	an instance variable current that keeps track of the current node on the list. Then the
	hasNext() method tests if current is null , and the next() method saves a reference
	to the current item, updates current to refer to the next node on the list, and returns
	the saved reference.

/*
 	This implementation maintains a linked list of the items provided in calls to add() . Code for
	isEmpty() and size() is the same as in Stack and is omitted. The iterator traverses the list, main-
	taining the current node in current . We can make Stack and Queue iterable by adding the code
	highlighted in red to Algorithms 1.1 and 1.2, because they use the same underlying data structure
	and Stack and Queue maintain the list in LIFO and FIFO order, respectively.
