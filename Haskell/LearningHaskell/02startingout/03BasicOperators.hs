Basic operators

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Arithmetic “operators” |	+, -, *, / |
| Boolean “operators” |	&&, ||, ==, /=, not |
| String concatenation |	++ |
| List concatenation |	++ |


Note:

The “not-equal” operator in Haskell is /=, which is unlike most other languages which use != for the same purpose.
The boolean negation operation in Haskell is not, which is unlike most other languages which use ! for the same purpose.
