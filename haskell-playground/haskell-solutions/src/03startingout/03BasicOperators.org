*** Basic operators

| Arithmetic “operators” | +, -, *, /                                            |
| Boolean “operators”    | &&, (two vertical pipes - stands for OR), ==, /=, not |
| String concatenation   | ++                                                    |
| List concatenation     | ++                                                    |


Note:

The “not-equal” operator in Haskell is /=, which is unlike most other languages which use != for the same purpose.
The boolean negation operation in Haskell is not, which is unlike most other languages which use ! for the same purpose.
