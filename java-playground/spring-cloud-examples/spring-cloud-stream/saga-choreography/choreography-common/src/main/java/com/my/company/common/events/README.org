Why do the method names in OrderSaga and DomainEvent look like that?
Because, we are using records in InventoryEvent, OrderEvent, PaymentEvent and ShippingEvent.
With records, a method gets created for every field (without the word "get").
So, by using the method names createdAt() and orderId() in the parent interface, we are supporting the generated methods in the records.
