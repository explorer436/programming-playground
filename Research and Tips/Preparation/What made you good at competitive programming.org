Lots of practice and a good practising strategy. Having a bad practice strategy (only solving easy problems, never upsolving, etc.) is very inefficient so it takes a lot of time to improve and can be discouraging as well.

This is the practising strategy I recommend-

Take part in as many contests as you can. After each contest solve at least 1-2 problems above your level.

If you find a new concept that was used to solve this problem -> Find a good tutorial on that concept and learn it (or find it here - Sameer Gulati's answer to What is a list of data structures that a competitive programmer must know?) . Most likely at the end of that tutorial there will be some practice problems. Try to do 5-15 problems (can be much higher for some things like Dynamic Programming) until you get sort of an intuition for it.

Your rating will go down at first but you will be practising your problem solving skills and contest skills simultaneously so I find this method better than just practising without taking part in contests.

The contests you should take part in for this strategy depends on your level

For Beginners-

Codechef Long Contests and Cook offs

Codeforces Contests (all of them)

Atcoder Beginner Contests

For Experienced (1600+ on Codeforces)-

Atcoder Contests (all of them)

Codechef Cook offs

Codeforces Contests (all of them)

You can participate virtually on Codeforces in case there is no online contest.
