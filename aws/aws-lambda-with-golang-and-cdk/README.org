The go1.x runtime is deprecated, but it doesn't mean that golang executing in a lambda is deprecated.
You just need to
 1. specify that you're going to use a custom runtime like provided.al2 (See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-golang.html#golang-al1) and
 1. name your compiled binary "bootstrap" in the root of the zip that gets deployed
 1. or you can deploy using containers stored in ECR and specify any given entrypoint in the Dockerfile if you need more flexibility.
