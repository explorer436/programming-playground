    At the tree level, 
    the height and the depth are always going to have equal values 
    (even thought they do not represent the same thing).
    So, the solution in "MyBinarySearchTree_Height.hs" can also be used to calculate depth. 
    If you need a solution to specifically calculate the depth based on it's definition, 
    it is going to look  similar to the solution in "MyBinarySearchTree_Height".
