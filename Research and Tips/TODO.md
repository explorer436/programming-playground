When it comes to solving problems, what is the endgoal here? 
The endgoal is to get to a point where I can think of a problem in my mind and be able to easily translate it into a solution on paper and implement it using a language (Java or Haskell). And then expand upon the problems. Plus, it is fun to solve puzzles.

When looking at new problems online, resist the urge to solve them right away. Instead, focus more on where the question is coming from. Are there more questions there? Do you have an in-depth understanding of the topic? If not, spend time on it. 
After getting a deeper understanding of the concept, see step below.
Whenever you read about an algorithm or computer science concept, implementing a solution for it either in Java or in Haskell or any of your favorite languages will help remember it in the future.
Note: Solving problems using pen and paper seems way more easier than tring to write code for it first. The free flow of thoughts is very helpful.

Project Euler - solve the challenges

Implement the logic for the problems specified in the "preparation" folder.

Understand how CustomHashCreatorUtil.java is working.

List of things that we need to be able to do without looking up on the internet:
	* Put some values in a HashMap and loop through the key value pairs.
	* Use java 8 collections more effectively.
	
Practice:
1. Write a small Java application that uses the String class to input one word at a time and
outputs a complete sentence when a terminating punctuation mark is entered.
2. Write an application similar to the one in exercise 1, but output the words in the sentence in
reverse order.
3. Write the same application using a single StringBuffer object passed to the input
method to collect the words in the sentence.
4. Write a class MutableInteger similar to the Java core class Integer but with the
capability to change the value of the integer. (The Integer class, like the String class, is
immutable after it is initialized.)

github.com/janestreet - They seem to be doing a lot of interesting stuff with OCaml. It would be worth spending time looking at their stuff if we need to get a better understanding of Ocaml.

Getting good at ADTs (abstract data types) will eventually get us ready for solving a lot of other problems like bracket balancing, etc. It will also lay a good foundation for trees and graphs.

----------------------

Find an efficient implementation for generating a Fibonacci sequence - do not pay too much attention to the language - language doesn't matter.
