Find Pythagorean Triplets

This problem was recently asked by Uber:

Given a list of numbers, find if there exists a pythagorean triplet in that list. A pythagorean triplet is 3 variables a, b, c 
where (a power 2) + (b power 2) = (c power 2)

Example:

Input: [3, 5, 12, 5, 13]
Output: True

Here, 52 + 122 = 132.

def findPythagoreanTriplets(nums):
  # Fill this in.

print findPythagoreanTriplets([3, 12, 5, 13])
# True
