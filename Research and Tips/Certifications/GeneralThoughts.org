Some people seem to say that certifications are not all that useful or important.
Some people say otherwise.

One thing is for certain.
They do seem to carry some weight during job interviews.
It wouldn't be a bad idea to get certified in the latest technologies and toolstacks just to prove that you are familiar with the concepts.
There are no negative consequences at all.
So, there is no reason for not doing them.
