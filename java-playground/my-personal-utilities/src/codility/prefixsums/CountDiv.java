Level : Respectable

Compute number of integers divisible by k in range [a..b].


   Write a function:
   
   class Solution { public int solution(int A, int B, int K); }
   
   that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within
   the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:
   
   { i : A <= i <= B, i mod K = 0 }
   
   For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3,
   because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11],
   namely 6, 8 and 10.
   
   Assume that:
   
   A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000]; K is an integer
   within the range [1..2,000,000,000]; A <= B. 
   
   Complexity:
   expected worst-case time complexity is O(1); expected worst-case space
   complexity is O(1).
