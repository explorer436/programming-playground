*** See all Unpushed commits or commits that are not in another branch

| git cherry -v                   | If you need to find out which of your local commits are not on the remote server do this. The -v option prints out the commit messages. Without it you will see only the SHA1 codes.                   |
| git cherry -v origin/somebranch | You may also compare against another (upstream) branch like that. This tool is especially useful when you have a ton of commits after a merge and want to know the commit differences between branches |
| git show (COMMIT_HASH)          | Once you have the list from the command above, use this to see the files that changed in each commit                                                                                                   |

*** Remove all your local branches except master

    Sometimes, you may want  to delete all your local branches except master

    #+begin_src 
    git branch | grep -ve " master$" | xargs git branch -D
    #+end_src

    You can also use an alias:

    #+begin_src 
    alias gbr="git branch | grep -ve " master$" | xargs git branch -D"
    #+end_src

*** How to see the file differences between a local branch and a remote branch

    Needless to say, before doing this, fetch all the updates from the remote first.

    #+begin_src 
    git diff <local branch> <remote branch>
    #+end_src
