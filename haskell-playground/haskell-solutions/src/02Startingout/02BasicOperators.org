*** Basic operators

| Operators              | Examples            |
|------------------------+---------------------|
| Arithmetic “operators” | +, -, *, /          |
| Boolean “operators”    | &&, ¦¦, ==, /=, not |
| String concatenation   | ++                  |
| List concatenation     | ++                  |


Note:

The ~not-equal~ operator in Haskell is ~/=~, which is unlike most other languages which use ~!=~ for the same purpose.
The boolean negation operation in Haskell is ~not~, which is unlike most other languages which use ~!~ for the same purpose.
