Ok, there is a Haskell FP introductory online course on edx(https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0), by Erik Meijer, I did that and it is great. Put yourself on the waiting list and try to access materials and home works. You can find the lectures here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIUlFQH4Cvo&list=PLoJC20gNfC2gpI7Dl6fg8uj1a-wfnWTH8)  at all times, so happy learning!

There are a few books also: the Haskell book by Graham (http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/book.html)  and "learn yourself a haskell for the greater good" (http://learnyouahaskell.com/) are 2 books I used and they are good. Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell (http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000929)  is a good follow up for one of the Haskell core strengths.

Use your computer and practice while reading or doing the MOOC. You will find all of these in the first google results of this Google search, read carefully.

Again, edx FP MOOC, (the Haskell book by Graham) and "learn yourself a haskell for the greater good" are the first 2 resources, than, you have more options.
