	/**
	 * Differences Between Aggregate Operations and Iterators:
	 * Aggregate operations, like forEach, appear to be like iterators. However, they have several fundamental differences:
	 * 
	 * 1. They use internal iteration: 
	 * Aggregate operations do not contain a method like next to instruct them to process the next element of the collection. 
	 * With internal delegation, your application determines what collection it iterates, 
	 * but the JDK determines how to iterate the collection. 
	 * With external iteration, your application determines both what collection it iterates and how it iterates it. 
	 * However, external iteration can only iterate over the elements of a collection sequentially. 
	 * Internal iteration does not have this limitation. 
	 * It can more easily take advantage of parallel computing, which involves dividing a problem into subproblems, solving those problems simultaneously, 
	 * and then combining the results of the solutions to the subproblems. See the section Parallelism (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/parallelism.html) for more information.
	 * 
	 * 2. They process elements from a stream: 
	 * Aggregate operations process elements from a stream, not directly from a collection. 
	 * Consequently, they are also called stream operations.
	 * 
	 * 3. They support behavior as parameters: 
	 * You can specify lambda expressions as parameters for most aggregate operations. 
	 * This enables you to customize the behavior of a particular aggregate operation.

	/**
	 * Pipelines
	 * 
	 * A pipeline is a sequence of aggregate operations.
	 * Components in a pipeline :
	 * 1. source, which is a collection (in this example, it is people)
	 * 2. intermediate operations (in this example, filter)
	 * 3. a terminal operation (in this example, foreach)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The filter operation returns a new stream that contains elements that match its predicate (this operation's parameter).
	 * 
	 * The terminal operation is supposed to produce a non-stream result, 
	 * such as a primitive value (like a double value), a collection, or in the case of forEach, no value at all.
	 * 
	 * In this example, the parameter of the forEach operation is the lambda expression e -> System.out.println(e.getName()), 
	 * which invokes the method getName on the object e. 
	 * (The Java runtime and compiler infer that the type of the object e is Person.)

		It is not necessary to remember these special cases and implement our own implemetations using reduce function. However, these are handy for simple operations.
		
		The JDK also contains reduction operations that return a collection instead of a single value. 
		Many reduction operations perform a specific task, such as finding the average of values or grouping elements into categories. 
		However, the JDK provides you with the general-purpose reduction operations reduce and collect - which we can use to write custom code.
