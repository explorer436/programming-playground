JPQL only supports a subset of SQL standard. If you want to make complex queries, take a look at Native SQL Query.

This shows how to execute SQL native query in Spring Boot with @Query annotation.

1. define SQL in the value attribute
1. set the nativeQuery attribute value to true

You need to note that:
1. Spring Data JPA don’t adjust the query to database’s specific SQL dialect, so ensure that the provided statement is supported by RDBMS.
1. Spring Data JPA does not currently support dynamic sorting for native queries, because it would have to manipulate the actual query declared, which it cannot do reliably for native SQL.
