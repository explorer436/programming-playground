What are your reasons you are trying to learn Haskell? What is the endgoal?

To get a better understanding of the paradigm 'functional programming' 
(as opposed to trying to solve everything using object oriented approach)
Most of the aspects of functional programming can be used in object oriented designs as well. 
Looking at solutions written in Haskell actually makes things a lot easier to understand compared to understanding programs written in Java.
My aim is to get to a point where I can think of a solution to a given problem in my mind and easily translate it into a solution using Haskell.

--------------------------------

Questions that I had when I first started thinking about Haskell:

Can we write a small web service application and deploy it?
Are they more performant than traditional languages like C, Java, etc.
How are they compared to Rust and Go?
Can we deploy them within CloudForge or in AWS or in Azure or in GCP?
Single threaded or multi threaded?

--------------------------------

Features that I find very interesting in Haskell:
Expressive static types
Higher order functions
Purity
Laziness
