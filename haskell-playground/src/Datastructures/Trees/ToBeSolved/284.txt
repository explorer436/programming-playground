Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Yext.

Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram 4 and 6 are cousins.

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6

Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.

Approach:
1. Use NumberOfCousinsInLevelOrder.hs
2. Get the parent of 5 using getParentOfANode.
3. Get the parents of all nodes in the list from step 1 and filter out the rest.
4. The result from step 4 is what we are looking for.
