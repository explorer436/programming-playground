Many, many years ago, in a distant part of the Orient—in the Vietnamese city of Hanoi—the emper-
or’s wiseperson passed on to join his ancestors. The emperor needed a replacement wiseperson. Being
a rather wise person himself, the emperor devised a puzzle, declaring that its solver could have the job
of wiseperson.

The puzzle consists of n disks (we don’t know exactly how many) and three poles: 
A (the source), B (the destination), and C (the spare). 
The disks were of different sizes and had holes in the
middle so that they could fit on the poles. Because of their great weight, the disks could be placed only
on top of disks larger than themselves. Initially, all the disks were on pole A, as shown in TowersOfHanoi.png scenario-a.
The puzzle was to move the disks, one by one, from pole A to pole B. A person could also use pole C in
the course of the transfer, but again a disk could be placed only on top of a disk larger than itself.

As the position of wiseperson was generally known to be a soft job, there were many applicants.
Scholars and peasants alike brought the emperor their solutions. Many solutions were thousands of
steps long, and many contained deeply nested loops and control structures. “I can’t understand these
solutions,” bellowed the emperor. “There must be an easy way to solve this puzzle.”

And indeed there was. A great Buddhist monk came out of the mountains to see the emperor.
“My son,” he said, “the puzzle is so easy, it almost solves itself.” The emperor’s security chief wanted
to throw this strange person out, but the emperor let him continue.

“If you have only one disk (that is, n = 1), move it from pole A to pole B.” 
So far, so good, but even the village idiot could get that part right. 
“If you have more than one disk (that is, n > 1), simply
1. Ignore the bottom disk and solve the problem for n – 1 disks, with the small modification that
pole C is the destination and pole B is the spare. (See TowersOfHanoi.png scenario b)
2. After you have done this, n – 1 disks will be on pole C, and the largest disk will remain on
pole A. So solve the problem for n = 1 (recall that even the village idiot could do this) by
moving the large disk from A to B. (See TowersOfHanoi.png scenario-c.)
3. Now all you have to do is move the n – 1 disks from pole C to pole B ; that is, solve the
problem with pole C as the source, pole B as the destination, and pole A as the spare.”
(See TowersOfHanoi.png scenario-d.)

There was silence for a few moments, and finally the emperor said impatiently, “Well, are you
going to tell us your solution or not?” The monk simply gave an all-knowing smile and vanished.
The emperor obviously was not a recursive thinker, but you should realize that the monk’s solution
is perfectly correct. The key to the solution is the observation that you can solve the Towers problem of n
disks by solving three smaller—in the sense of number of disks —Towers problems. 

Let towers(count, source, destination, spare) denote the problem of moving count disks from pole source to pole
destination , using pole spare as a spare. Notice that this definition makes sense even if there are more
than count disks on pole source ; in this case, you concern yourself with only the top count disks and
ignore the others. Similarly, the poles destination and spare might have disks on them before you
begin; you ignore these, too, except that you may place only smaller disks on top of them.
You can restate the emperor’s problem as follows: Beginning with n disks on pole A and zero
disks on poles B and C, solve towers(n, A, B, C) . You can state the monk’s solution as follows:

Step 1. Starting in the initial state—with all the disks on pole A—solve the problem 
towers(n - 1, A, C, B)
That is, ignore the bottom (largest) disk and move the top n – 1 disks from pole A to pole C,
using pole B as a spare. When you are finished, the largest disk will remain on pole A, and all
the other disks will be on pole C.

Step 2. Now, with the largest disk on pole A and all others on pole C, solve the problem
towers(1, A, B, C)
That is, move the largest disk from pole A to pole B. Because this disk is larger than the disks
already on the spare pole C, you really could not use the spare. However, fortunately—and
obviously—you do not need to use the spare in this base case. When you are done, the largest
disk will be on pole B, and all other disks will remain on pole C.

Step 3. Finally, with the largest disk on pole B and all the other disks on pole C, solve the problem
towers(n - 1, C, B, A)
That is, move the n – 1 disks from pole C to pole B, using A as a spare. Notice that the destina-
tion pole B already has the largest disk, which you ignore. When you are done, you will have
solved the original problem: All the disks will be on pole B.
