What's wrong with loving JavaScript? I never understood why I can’t use it for everything.

quora.com  Richard Kenneth Eng's answer to What's wrong with loving JavaScript? I never understood why I can’t use it for everything.

The simple reason is that JavaScript is one of the worst designed programming languages in the history of programming languages (putting aside joke languages like Brainfuck). For starters, it doesn’t even have an integer data type! What other language doesn’t have integers?

JavaScript doesn’t have normal arrays as most programmers understand them. JavaScript is one of the only few languages in existence that have weak typing (not to be confused with dynamic typing), which results in many crazy-ass coercions. JavaScript is the only language I know of that can actually fail silently at runtime due to syntactical errors!

And I’ve just barely scratched the surface. The fact that a book like Douglas Crockford’s “JavaScript: The Good Parts” is even necessary tells you all you need to know. The fact that a linter is practically mandatory for using JavaScript safely speaks volumes.

You can’t even use JavaScript to prepare a beginner for the IT profession because nearly ALL other major languages are class-based OOP languages…Java, PHP, Python, C#, C++, Ruby, Objective-C, Perl, Scala, Swift. JavaScript is heavily based on object prototypes, a dubious feature shared by only one other language of any significance: Lua.

So JavaScript will teach you a whole lot of bad habits that are not transferrable to the rest of the IT industry.

You have to understand that the ONLY reason JavaScript dominates in web development is because web devs have no choice. JavaScript is the ONLY language available in the web browser. If web devs had a choice, they sure as hell wouldn’t choose a moronic language like JavaScript!

Here’s the truth: the web development community has effectively been held hostage by JavaScript. Only the Stockholm syndrome convinces everybody that it’s a good language. What this community seriously needs is a “deprogrammer.”

Sure, JavaScript has a presence in several other domains, but in mobile, Java and Objective-C/Swift rule. In desktop, Java, C++, and others are popular. In games, it’s pretty much all down to C# and C++. In cloud computing, it’s Java. In numerical computing, it’s Java, Python, and C++. In data science, it’s R and Python. In finance, it’s C++ and Python. In robotics and the Internet of Things, Java, Python, C, and others are extremely popular. And so on.

Outside of web development, JavaScript has traction server-side, but Node has rather limited applicability. For high performance, high availability server applications, there are many superior alternatives such as Java, Scala, Clojure, Go, Erlang, etc.

Despite what others may tell you, JavaScript is not the universal programming language. To do well in the IT industry, you need to be polyglot. So broaden your scope with Java and Python, at the very least, and give serious consideration to picking up Go, C#, and one of the FP languages (such as Haskell, Clojure, Erlang).
