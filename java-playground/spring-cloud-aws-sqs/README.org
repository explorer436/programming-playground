* Set up steps

Create a standard queue and a corresponding DLQ and link the two of them together in the console:
1. my-dead-letter-queue-df5f29db
2. my-standard-queue-df5f29db

Make sure you set the "maxReceiveCount" on the standard queue set to a number that is greater than "1".

When you call the endpoint,
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/message/sqs2' --data-raw ''
you should see the log message ">>> listener picked up message from the queue at 10:38:10.527109400" printed on the console 10 times (or the number of times equal to "maxReceiveCount" value of the standard queue).
After the message fails to process 10 times, the message will be moved to the DLQ.
