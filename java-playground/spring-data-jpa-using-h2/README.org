* springboot jpa

A sample project that uses h2 for database.

The tests hit the h2 database instead of using mocking.

* gotchas while working with spring-boot-starter-data-jpa

** Not a managed type error

Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'carService' defined in file [/home/h/Downloads/GitRepositories/programming-playground/java-playground/spring-data-jpa-using-h2/target/classes/com/mycompany/springdatajpausingh2/inventory/services/CarService.class]: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor parameter 0: Error creating bean with name 'carRepository' defined in com.mycompany.springdatajpausingh2.inventory.repositories.CarRepository defined in @EnableJpaRepositories declared on JpaRepositoriesRegistrar.EnableJpaRepositoriesConfiguration: Not a managed type: class com.mycompany.springdatajpausingh2.inventory.entities.Car

why:
spring could not find entity classes

cause:
Entity classes are not under the package that contains springboot main class

solution:
1. move the entity classes to the package that contains springboot main class
1. rename the package containing the main class
1. use @EntityScan annotation
