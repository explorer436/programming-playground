* Run the program to output the name of the directories on the console.

* Compare the performace of this method in Haskell with the performance of the java method.
If necessary, modify both of them to write the results to a file directly.

Try in Haskell:
- matching brackets problem
- binary tree structure with letters in a string
- backtracking a tree starting from the nodes
- working with linked lists
- suffix tree like data structures - what do they mean?

Write a program to retrieve the highest or lowest element from a list. When there are duplicate elements, write separate functions to retrieve the one from the left and the one from the left.
Write a program to retrieve the index of the highest or lowest element from a list. When there are duplicate elements, write separate functions to retrieve the one from the left and the one from the left.

Building trees back from the string representations of the various traversal techniques.

Working with OpenAPI specs for REST APIs. How to do that?

Pretty print a binary tree or a binary search tree. In a vertical tree like structure with branches showing the left and right subtrees. This will be very useful while printing the results of various operations on trees. The default structure that is printed on the console is a little helpful but it gets difficult to read it if the tree gets relatively big. Printing the tree in a visual form will be very helpful.
