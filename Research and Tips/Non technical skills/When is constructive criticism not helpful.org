At what point does “constructive” criticism of your code become unhelpful?

    When it is too late: “I would use a different design”
    When it is pure nit picking: “I would have called ‘create’ ‘realise’
    When there is a deadline and we can accept the tech debt
    When it results from inter personal conflicts
    When it is based on a misunderstanding of the subject and constraints
