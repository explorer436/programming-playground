    A rock band would like to tour n cities. Unfortunately, time will allow for visits to only k cities.
The band’s agent considers the different choices for visiting k cities out of the n possibilities.
Because time is short, the band members are not concerned about the order in which they visit the
same k cities.

Let g ( n, k ) be the number of groups of k cities chosen from n . If we consider city C, either we visit
C or we do not. If we do visit city C, we will have to choose k - 1 other cities to visit from the n - 1
remaining cities. Thus, the number of groups of cities that include C is g ( n - 1, k - 1). On the other
hand, if we do not visit city C, we will have to choose k cities to visit from the remaining n - 1 cities.
The number of groups of cities that do not include C is g ( n - 1, k ). Thus, we can compute g ( n, k ) by
solving two smaller counting problems of the same type; that is,
g ( n , k ) = g(n - 1, k - 1) + g(n - 1, k )

We still need to fi nd the base case(s) and demonstrate that each of the two smaller problems even-
tually reaches a base case. First, if the band had time to visit all n cities—that is, if k equals n— there is
only one group of all the cities. Thus, the fi rst base case is
g ( k , k ) = 1

If k < n, the second term g ( n - 1, k ) in the recursive defi nition will reach this base case, because at
each successive stage of the recursion, n ⫺ 1 decreases until it reaches k . However, the first term, g ( n - 1,
k - 1), does not reach this base case. Since n - 1 and k - 1 both decrease at the same rate, they will never
become equal. The first term does, in fact, approach another trivial selection problem. Just as there is only
one group of all the cities ( k = n ), there is also only one group of zero cities ( k = 0). Thus, the second base
case is
g ( n , 0) = 1
and will be reached by the fi rst term, g ( n - 1, k - 1). 
(Alternatively, you could define the second base case to be g ( n, 1) = n .)

Remember : When you solve a problem by solving two (or more) smaller problems, each of
the smaller problems must be closer to a base case than the original problem.

For completeness, we add one final part to this recursive solution:
g ( n , k ) = 0   if k > n

Although k could not be greater than n in the context of this problem, the addition of this case makes
the recursive solution more generally applicable.

To summarize, the following recursive solution solves the problem of choosing k out of n
things:

g ( n, k ) = 1   if k = 0
g ( n, k ) = 1   if k = n
g ( n, k ) = 0   if k > 0
g ( n, k ) = g(n - 1, k -1 ) + g(n - 1, k)  if 0 < k < n
