* Observer pattern

Person1: So I created a broadcast class. It keeps track of all the objects listening to it, and anytime a new piece of data comes along, it sends a message to each listener. Whats cool is that the listeners can join the broadcast at any time or they can even remove themselves. It is really dynamic and loosely coupled.

Person2: Why didn't you judt say you are using the Observer pattern?
