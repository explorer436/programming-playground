How can we have multiple main() in same crate?

I'm trying to code some very simple utilities to help me manipulating source code from command line. (e.g. extracting headers from Java or Python sources)

Most of these programs just pick a file from command line args, and after some checking, load its contents, calls a function and outputs the result.

I can create a crate for each small program, of course, but I wonder if it is possible to define more than one main() in the same crate.

So the question is: is it possible (and how) to define more than one main() in the same crate?

Answer:

1. Instead of ~src/main.rs~ you can have ~src/bin/tool1.rs~ and ~src/bin/tool2.rs~ etc. If you then have ~src/lib.rs~ then all those can access a single support crate for code, making things compile faster.
1. structops is an alternative.
