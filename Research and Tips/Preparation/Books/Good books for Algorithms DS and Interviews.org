You won't crack top tech interviews with the CLRS book alone because it ignores practical programming languages. At tech interviews, you need to write code on a whiteboard in real time using C++, Java or C#, which requires significant skill and practice, as well as a number of good examples.

If you need one book, I recommend this one:
Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++: Mark A. Weiss (note that it's the 4th edition; 3rd edition is OK, but does not use C++11)

But that is probably not enough to develop problem-solving skills.
There are (at least) two excellent books to use when preparing for tech interviews:

1. Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions: Gayle Laakmann McDowell
1. Elements of Programming Interviews: 300 Questions and Solutions: Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash, Tsung-Hsien Lee

There are several other books targeting interviews in the financial industry.
