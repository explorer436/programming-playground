    Pangram
    Write a function to determine if a given string is a pangram. 
    A pangram is defined as a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. 
    It is allowed to use some letters more than once, 
    but it must use every letter at least once. For example:

    -- This is pangram. Notice that it uses 'o', 't', 'h', 'e' more than once.

    More pangrams for testing your code:

    Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
    We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize
    Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag
    Sphinx of black quartz: judge my vow
