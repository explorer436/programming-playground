/**
 *
     Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference
     between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number is 12, its reverse is 21.
     Their difference is 9. The number 120 reversed is 21, and their difference is 99.
     .
     She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will
     only go to a movie on a beautiful day .
     Given a range of numbered days, [i,...,j] and a number k,
     determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful.
     Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where |i - reverse(i)|
     is evenly divisible by k.
     If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Print the number of beautiful days in the
     range.

     Function Description
     Complete the beautifulDays function in the editor below. It must return the number of beautiful days in
     the range.
     beautifulDays has the following parameter(s):
     i: the starting day number
     j: the ending day number
     k: the divisor

     Input Format
     A single line of three space-separated integers describing the respective values of i, j, and k.

     Constraints
     1 <= i <= j <= 2 * 10 ^ 6
     1 <= k <= 2 * 10 ^ 9

     Output Format
     Print the number of beautiful days in the inclusive range between i and j.

     Sample Input
     20 23 6
     Sample Output
     2
     Explanation
     Lily may go to the movies on days 20, 21, 22 and 23.
     Only two days, 20 and 22, in this interval are beautiful. Thus, we print 2 as our answer.
