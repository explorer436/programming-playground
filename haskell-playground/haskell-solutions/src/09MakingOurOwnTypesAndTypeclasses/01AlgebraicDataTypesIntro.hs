-- In the previous chapters, we covered some existing Haskell types and typeclasses.
-- In this chapter, we'll learn how to make our own and how to put them to work!

-- Algebraic data types intro

-- Algebra is another fancy word which just means 
-- a sort of language of combining elements together — 
-- in this case, we’re combining types. 
-- You probably know this word from Maths if you’ve studied it.

-- Both sum types and product types are examples of algebraic data types. 
-- You can have combinations of these types in the one type, 
-- which means you can have types that are sums of product types.

-- So far, we've run into a lot of data types.
-- Bool, Int, Char, Maybe, etc.
-- But how do we make our own?
-- Well, one way is to use the data keyword to define a type.
-- Let's see how the Bool type is defined in the standard library.

-- data Bool = False | True 

-- data means that we're defining a new data type.
-- The part before the = denotes the type, which is Bool.
-- The parts after the = are value constructors.
-- They specify the different values that this type can have.
-- The | is read as or.
-- So we can read this as: the Bool type can have a value of True or False.
-- Both the type name and the value constructors have to be capital cased.

-- In a similar fashion, we can think of the Int type as being defined like this:

-- data Int = -2147483648 | -2147483647 | ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 2147483647 

-- The first and last value constructors are 
-- the minimum and maximum possible values of Int.
-- It's not actually defined like this,
-- the ellipses are here because we omitted a heapload of numbers,
-- so this is just for illustrative purposes.

-- Now, let's think about how we would represent a shape in Haskell.
-- One way would be to use tuples.
-- A circle could be denoted as (43.1, 55.0, 10.4) 
-- where the first and second fields are 
-- the coordinates of the circle's center and 
-- the third field is the radius. 
-- Sounds OK, but those could also represent a 3D vector or anything else.
-- A better solution would be to make our own type to represent a shape.
-- Let's say that a shape can be a circle or a rectangle.
-- Here it is:

-- data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float 
data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float deriving (Show)  

-- Now what's this?
-- Think of it like this.
-- The Circle value constructor has three fields, which take floats.
-- So when we write a value constructor,
-- we can optionally add some types after it 
-- and those types define the values it will contain.
-- Here, the first two fields are the coordinates of its center, the third one its radius.
-- The Rectangle value constructor has four fields which accept floats.
-- The first two are the coordinates to its upper left corner and 
-- the second two are coordinates to its lower right one.

-- Now when I say fields, I actually mean parameters.
-- Value constructors are actually functions 
-- that ultimately return a value of a data type.
-- Let's take a look at the type signatures for these two value constructors.

-- ghci> :t Circle  
-- Circle :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Shape  
-- ghci> :t Rectangle  
-- Rectangle :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Float -> Shape  

-- Cool, so value constructors are functions like everything else. Who would have thought? Let's make a function that takes a shape and returns its surface.

surface :: Shape -> Float  
surface (Circle _ _ r) = pi * r ^ 2  
surface (Rectangle x1 y1 x2 y2) = (abs $ x2 - x1) * (abs $ y2 - y1)  

-- The first notable thing here is the type declaration. 
-- It says that the function takes a shape and returns a float.
-- We couldn't write a type declaration of 
-- Circle -> Float because Circle is not a type, Shape is. 
-- Just like we can't write a function with a type declaration of True -> Int.
-- The next thing we notice here is that 
-- we can pattern match against constructors.
-- We pattern matched against constructors before (all the time actually) 
-- when we pattern matched against values like [] or False or 5,
-- only those values didn't have any fields.
-- We just write a constructor and then bind its fields to names.
-- Because we're interested in the radius,
-- we don't actually care about the first two fields,
-- which tell us where the circle is.

testSurface01 = surface $ Circle 10 20 10  
-- 314.15927  
testSurface02 = surface $ Rectangle 0 0 100 100  
-- 10000.0  

-- Yay, it works! 
-- But if we try to just print out Circle 10 20 5 in the prompt,
-- we'll get an error.
-- That's because Haskell doesn't know how to display our data type as a string (yet).
-- Remember, when we try to print a value out in the prompt,
-- Haskell first runs the show function to get 
-- the string representation of our value and 
-- then it prints that out to the terminal.
-- To make our Shape type part of the Show typeclass, we modify it like this:
-- data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float deriving (Show)  


-- We won't concern ourselves with deriving too much for now.
-- Let's just say that 
-- if we add deriving (Show) at the end of a data declaration,
-- Haskell automagically makes that type part of the Show typeclass.
-- So now, we can do this:

testCircle01 = Circle 10 20 5  
-- Circle 10.0 20.0 5.0  
testRectangle01 = Rectangle 50 230 60 90  
-- Rectangle 50.0 230.0 60.0 90.0  

-- Value constructors are functions,
-- so we can map them and partially apply them and everything.
-- If we want a list of concentric circles with different radii, we can do this.

testMapOnCircle01 = map (Circle 10 20) [4,5,6,6]  
-- [Circle 10.0 20.0 4.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 5.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 6.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 6.0] 

-- Our data type is good, although it could be better.
-- Let's make an intermediate data type that defines a point in two-dimensional space.
-- Then we can use that to make our shapes more understandable.

data Point = Point Float Float deriving (Show)  
data Shape2 = Circle2 Point Float | Rectangle2 Point Point deriving (Show)  

-- Notice that when defining a point,
-- we used the same name for the data type and the value constructor.
-- This has no special meaning,
-- although it's common to use the same name as the type 
-- if there's only one value constructor.
-- So now the Circle has two fields,
-- one is of type Point and the other of type Float.
-- This makes it easier to understand what's what.
-- Same goes for the rectangle.
-- We have to adjust our surface function to reflect these changes.

surface2 :: Shape2 -> Float  
surface2 (Circle2 _ r) = pi * r ^ 2  
surface2 (Rectangle2 (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2)) = (abs $ x2 - x1) * (abs $ y2 - y1)  

-- The only thing we had to change were the patterns.
-- We disregarded the whole point in the circle pattern.
-- In the rectangle pattern,
-- we just used a nested pattern matching to get the fields of the points.
-- If we wanted to reference the points themselves for some reason,
-- we could have used as-patterns.

testSurface2_01 = surface2 (Rectangle2 (Point 0 0) (Point 100 100))  
-- 10000.0  
testSurface2_02 = surface2 (Circle2 (Point 0 0) 24)  
-- 1809.5574  

-- How about a function that nudges a shape?
-- It takes a shape,
-- the amount to move it on the x axis and 
-- the amount to move it on the y axis and 
-- then returns a new shape that has the same dimensions,
-- only it's located somewhere else.

nudge :: Shape2 -> Float -> Float -> Shape2
nudge (Circle2 (Point x y) r) a b = Circle2 (Point (x+a) (y+b)) r  
nudge (Rectangle2 (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2)) a b = 
    Rectangle2 (Point (x1+a) (y1+b)) (Point (x2+a) (y2+b)) 

-- Pretty straightforward.
-- We add the nudge amounts to the points that denote the position of the shape.

testNudgeOnCircle2_01 = nudge (Circle2 (Point 34 34) 10) 5 10  
-- Circle (Point 39.0 44.0) 10.0

-- If we don't want to deal directly with points,
-- we can make some auxilliary functions that create shapes of some size 
-- at the zero coordinates and then nudge those.

baseCircle :: Float -> Shape2
baseCircle r = Circle2 (Point 0 0) r  
  
baseRect :: Float -> Float -> Shape2
baseRect width height = Rectangle2 (Point 0 0) (Point width height)  
testNudgeOnBaseRect01 = nudge (baseRect 40 100) 60 23  
-- Rectangle (Point 60.0 23.0) (Point 100.0 123.0) 

-- You can, of course, export your data types in your modules.
-- To do that, just write your type along with the functions you are exporting 
-- and then add some parentheses and 
-- in them specify the value constructors that you want to export for it,
-- separated by commas.
-- If you want to export all the value constructors for a given type, just write `...`

-- If we wanted to export the functions and types 
-- that we defined here in a module,
-- we could start it off like this:

-- module Shapes   
-- ( Point(..)  
-- , Shape(..)  
-- , surface  
-- , nudge  
-- , baseCircle  
-- , baseRect  
-- ) where  
    
-- By doing Shape(..), 
-- we exported all the value constructors for Shape,
-- so that means that whoever imports our module can make shapes by 
-- using the Rectangle and Circle value constructors.
-- It's the same as writing Shape (Rectangle, Circle).

-- We could also opt not to export any value constructors for Shape by 
-- just writing Shape in the export statement.
-- That way, someone importing our module could only make shapes by 
-- using the auxilliary functions baseCircle and baseRect. 
-- Data.Map uses that approach.
-- You can't create a map by doing Map.Map [(1,2),(3,4)] because 
-- it doesn't export that value constructor.
-- However, you can make a mapping by 
-- using one of the auxilliary functions like Map.fromList.
-- Remember, value constructors are just functions that take the fields as parameters 
-- and return a value of some type (like Shape) as a result.
-- So when we choose not to export them,
-- we just prevent the person importing our module from using those functions,
-- but if some other functions that are exported return a type,
-- we can use them to make values of our custom data types.

-- Not exporting the value constructors of a data types makes them more abstract 
-- in such a way that we hide their implementation.
-- Also, whoever uses our module can't pattern match against the value constructors.
