* Testing

Start the application first.
Then, go to the cli and create the ~target_znode~ node.
#+begin_src
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 3] create /target_znode "some parent data"
#+end_src

The application should receive notifications about it.
#+begin_src
17:34:16.390 [main-SendThread(localhost:2181)] DEBUG org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn - Got WatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type:NodeCreated path:/target_znode for session id 0x10066e94a9a0007
/target_znode was created
Data: some parent data, children : []
#+end_src

Now change the data on the node
#+begin_src
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 4] set /target_znode "some new data"
#+end_src
The application should receive notifications about it.
#+begin_src

/target_znode data changed
Data: some new data, children : []
#+end_src

Now create a child node to ~target_znode~
#+begin_src
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 5] create /target_znode/child_node "some child data"
#+end_src
The application should receive notifications about it.
#+begin_src
/target_znode children changed
Data: some new data, children : [child_node]
#+end_src

Now, recursively delete the node and all it's children
#+begin_src
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 6] deleteall /target_znode
#+end_src
The application should receive notifications about it.
