It may be ok to ignore some types of exceptions and acknowledge them and move on.

But there may be scenarios where we don't want the consumer to acknowledge a message until it is processed successfully.

In those scenarios, we have to handle the exceptions and retries and acknowledgements based on the type of exceptions.

1. We will not acknowledge the message if the error is ~DB is down~ error.
1. We will acknowledge the message if the error is ~IndexOutOfBoundsException~ error.
