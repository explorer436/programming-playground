        // However, a key point to remember is that the return type will be combined of all calls.

        // So this method is useful when we want to transform the result of a CompletableFuture call:
        CompletableFuture<Integer> finalResult01 = classUnderTest.compute().thenApply(s-> s + 1);
        System.out.println(finalResult01.get()); // 26

        // thenCompose()
        // The thenCompose() method is similar to thenApply() in that both return a new Completion Stage.
        // However, thenCompose() uses the previous stage as the argument.
        // It will flatten and return a Future with the result directly, rather than a nested future as we observed in thenApply():

        // So if the idea is to chain CompletableFuture methods then it’s better to use thenCompose().
        // Rule of thumb here - If your callback function returns a CompletableFuture, and you want a flattened result from the CompletableFuture chain (which in most cases you would), then use thenCompose().
        // Also, note that the difference between these two methods is analogous to the difference between map() and flatMap().
