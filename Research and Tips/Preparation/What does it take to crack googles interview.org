If you want to get placed in a company like Google then specifically, you should focus on preparation in the following areas of the coding:

    Programming Language. Familiar with at least one coding language and typically Google will interview you in C++ or Java and you may use Python in different projects.
    You will be expected to know object-oriented design and programming and how to test your code.
    Data structures and algorithms. Another big thing is the algorithm like you need to know the time and space complexity of your algorithm as well as how to improve or change it. You should know trees and some basic trees construction and traversal and manipulation algorithms, hash tables, stacks, arrays, linked lists.
    Discrete Mathematics. Also, some of the interviewers will ask you basic Discrete mathematics problems like probability and counting problems.
    Recursion. Some of the interviewers will ask you to solve iterative problems with a more elegant solution.
    Operating Systems. You should understand processes, threads, and concurrency issues such as semaphores, locks etc.
    Resource allocation and Context Switching.
    System Design.
    Candidates with three or more years of industry experience should have hands-on testing experience. If you've less than three years in the industry they are just gonna test your testing aptitude. They may even make you design integration questions or may even ask you security tests for real-world systems.

Mentorship is very important as a mentor will tell you about your weaknesses and strengths. An experienced mentor from the coding background will help you more than anyone else. What else could be better if your mentors are Experts themselves?

I know that you wish to get mentored by Experts from Google, Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm like mega-companies. You wish to get an interactive learning experience with skilled professionals.

What if I say You will get these all covered in one single program. Shocked?
