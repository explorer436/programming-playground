module Datastructures.Lists.RemoveDuplicatesFromList (removeDuplicateFromListLeftFold, removeDuplicateFromListRightFold) where

-- Given a list of integers, select at most one occurence of each integer, 
-- i.e. if the input is [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4] the output should be [1, 2, 3, 4].
-- You will be unable to write this function using only the filter function. 
-- This is because the condition in step 2, the lambda that you are passing, needs access to the result of each step.
-- This is exactly what foldl' gives you.
