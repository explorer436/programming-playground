In the 100+ interviews I've conducted across Google and Facebook, I've realized what one of the BIGGEST mistakes that candidates make while interviewing is.
 
What's that mistake?  Time management.  
 
You see, time matters... a lot.  In fact, "speed/efficiency" is one of the criteria that tech companies evaluate you on. 

Simply, speed demonstrates mastery.
 
These days, tech companies have banned illegal questions with tricky "aha!" moments, instead preferring coding problems that expand upon themselves.  These sorts of problems begin simple and build into higher complexity.  Or, there could be a series of related questions.
 
So, the name of the game is to see how far you can get through the series of problems, not to spend all of your time on just the first basic problem.  The best candidates will make it through all of the problems quickly.  And all the while, good candidates are guiding the conversation to highlight their strengths, rather than letting the interviewer ask random questions that just wastes valuable time.

OK, that's it!  Have a great holiday!
