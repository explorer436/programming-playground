What is the best way to prepare for Google interview in 3 months?

Jordan Bishop · October 20 Conducted dozens of technical interviews.

Fortunately, 3 months is a good amount of time for you to prepare for an interview with Google, assuming you’re preparing for the software engineer interview. Bear in mind, however, that an interviewer can ask you any question they desire at any point in time, so there’s still a bit of room for a surprise here and there.

There are two main aspects that are evaluated in these interviews, and the best way to cover both is to use multiple resources that mutually complement each other. These aspects are as follows:

    Behavioral aspect: This is the first aspect that’s taken into consideration during your interview, and it covers abilities such as being able to efficiently communicate as well as any leadership and teamwork skills that you could have. This is an aspect that other programmers usually tend to ignore in favor of having great coding skills, but it’s especially critical to have good soft skills when having an interview with Google: both because they take this aspect seriously due to their liking of seeing their candidates displaying Googliness

(which is a word used to describe the behavioral traits Google likes to see in their employees) and because it will help you stand out from other candidates who ignored this aspect completely.

To practice this your soft skills, you could use a site like Pramp
, which allows you to take part in multiple mock interviews with other software engineers (some of whom have worked at Google or Facebook before) while you receive objective feedback on your performance.
Technical aspect: Also known as the section of the interview where your technical knowledge and coding proficiency come into play. This aspect of the interview is divided into two important topics, which are data structures & algorithms and systems design.

DS&A usually covers concepts such as arrays, hash tables, linked lists, binary search trees, sorting algorithms, and bit manipulation, which will be your most useful tools for solving coding questions in your interview. There are plenty of ways to approach this topic: for example, if you prefer to read books, then I’d recommend you use Algorithm Design to learn the fundamentals of the topic without delving into any complex math. On the other hand, if you prefer instructional videos, you may want to enroll in a course like Tech Interview Pro
, which was created by an ex-Google software engineer and has two in-depth modules on data structures & algorithms (one basic, one advanced).

Then there’s the systems design topic, which covers concepts such as load balancing, caching, CDNs, databases, redundancy and replication, database sharding, and API design. For this topic, you could use a course like Educative’s Scalability And System Design Course
, which will teach you how to design scalable systems for enterprise-level software, or you could read a book like Designing Data-Intensive Applications, which has encyclopedic knowledge on data storage and distributed systems.
