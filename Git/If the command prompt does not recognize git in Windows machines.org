*** If the command prompt does not recognize git in Windows machines

    I have an installation of Git for Windows, but when I try to use the git command in Command Prompt, I get the following error: 'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. How to fix this problem?
    
    
    Have you correctly set your PATH to point at your Git installation?
    
    You need to add the following paths to PATH:

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    C:\Program Files\Git\bin\
    
    C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\
    #+END_SRC
