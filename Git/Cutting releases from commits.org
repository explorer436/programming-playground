cherry picking is an option but it seems tedious.

How to create branch from an old commit:
Using git bash:
git branch <branchname> <commitHash>

Process:
1. From eclipse eGit, checkout develop.
1. Go to history, select the commit and create a branch from the commit.
1. Run mvn clean install to make sure everything is good.
1. Push the branch.
1. Double check to see if any commits are missing. If so, do git cherry-pick
1. Create the pull request.
