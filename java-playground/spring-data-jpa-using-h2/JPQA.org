Spring JPA supports both JPQL and Native Query.

This shows how to interact with h2 database for basic CRUD operations on one table using Spring JPA's JPQL.

The Jakarta Persistence Query Language (JPQL; formerly Java Persistence Query Language) is a platform-independent object-oriented query language defined as part of the Jakarta Persistence (JPA; formerly Java Persistence API) specification â€“ Wikipedia

JPQL is inspired by SQL, and its queries resemble SQL queries in syntax, but operate against JPA entity objects stored in a relational database rather than directly with database tables.
