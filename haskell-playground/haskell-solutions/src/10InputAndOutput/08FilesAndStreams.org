    getChar is an I/O action that reads a single character from the terminal. getLine is an I/O action that reads a line from the terminal. These two are pretty straightforward and most programming languages have some functions or statements that are parallel to them. But now, let's meet getContents. getContents is an I/O action that reads everything from the standard input until it encounters an end-of-file character. Its type is getContents :: IO String. What's cool about getContents is that it does lazy I/O. When we do foo <- getContents, it doesn't read all of the input at once, store it in memory and then bind it to foo. No, it's lazy! It'll say: "Yeah yeah, I'll read the input from the terminal later as we go along, when you really need it!".
