* Using custom jvm-config with maven

  If maven is having trouble working with the jdk version installed in the machine, and if you need to use custom jvm-config with maven in a project, this is the way to do it:
  
  In the project, create a directory with this name: ".mvn"
  In this directory, create a file with this name: "jvm.config"
  Add your custom config in that file:

  #+begin_src 
  --add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED
  #+end_src
