/**
 * 
   The CompletableFuture.get() method is blocking. It waits until the Future is completed and returns the result after its completion.
   But, that is not what we want. 

   For building asynchronous systems we should be able to attach a callback to the CompletableFuture which should automatically get called when the Future completes.
   That way, we won’t need to wait for the result, and we can write the logic that needs to be executed after the completion of the Future inside our callback function.
   You can attach a callback to the CompletableFuture using thenApply(), thenAccept() and thenRun() methods -
   
   Note the behavioral keywords in thenApply:
   1. then, which means that the action of this stage happens when the current stage completes normally (without an exception). 
      In this case, the current stage is already completed with the value “message”.
   2. Apply, which means the returned stage will apply a Function on the result of the previous stage.
      The execution of the Function will be blocking, which means that get() will only be reached when the operation in thenApply() is done.

		// The thenApply() method accepts a CompletableFunction instance, uses it to process the result, and returns a Future that holds a value returned by a function:
		// Use thenApply() method to process and transform the result of a CompletableFuture when it arrives. 
		// It takes a Function<T,R> as an argument. 
		// Function<T,R> is a simple functional interface representing a function that accepts an argument of type T and produces a result of type R.

		/*
			Finally, if we neither need the value of the computation, nor want to return some value at the end of the chain, then we can pass a Runnable lambda to the thenRun method. 
			In the following example, we simply print a line in the console after calling the future.get():
