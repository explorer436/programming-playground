	Fixed-capacity stack. 

    As a strawman, 
    we consider an abstract data type for a fixed- capacity stack of strings. 
    The API differs from our Stack API: 
    it works only for String values, 
    it requires the client to specify a capacity, 
    and it does not support iteration. 
    The primary choice in developing an API implementation is 
    to choose a representation for the data. 
    For FixedCapacityStackOfStrings, 
    an obvious choice is to use an array of String values. 
    Pursuing this choice leads to the implementation shown at the bottom on the opposite page, 
    which could hardly be simpler (each method is a one-liner). 
    The instance variables are an array a[] that holds the items in the stack 
    and an integer N that counts the number of items in the stack. 
    To remove an item, we decrement N and then return a[N]; 
    to insert a new item, we set a[N] equal to the new item and then increment N. 

    These operations preserve the following properties:
	■ The items in the array are in their insertion order.
	■ The stack is empty when N is 0 .
	■ The top of the stack (if it is nonempty) is at a[N-1] .

	As usual, thinking in terms of invariants of this sort 
    is the easiest way to verify that an implementation operates as intended. 
    Be sure that you fully understand this implementation. 
    The best way to do so is to examine a trace of the stack contents 
    for a sequence of operations, 
    as illustrated at left for the test client, 
    which reads strings from standard input and pushes each string onto a stack, 
    unless it is "-" , when it pops the stack and prints the result. 
    The primary performance characteristic of this implementation is that 
    the push and pop operations take time independent of the stack size. 
    For many applications, it is the method of choice because of its simplicity.  

    But it has several drawbacks that limit its potential applicability 
    as a general-purpose tool, which we now address. 
    With a moderate amount of effort 
    (and some help from Java language mechanisms), 
    we can develop an implementation that is broadly useful. 
    This effort is worthwhile because 
    the implementations that we develop serve as a model for implementations of other, 
    more powerful, abstract data types throughout the book.
