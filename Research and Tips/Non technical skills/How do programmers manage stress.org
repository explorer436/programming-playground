How do programmers manage stress daily?

You know, being a software developer really isn’t all that stressful. You mostly sit at your desk in front of your laptop with your headphones on and do your thing. Sometimes there are meetings, and once in a while the coffee machine breaks down, which is probably the most stressful part of the job.

Compared to jobs that are actually stressful, like being a teacher or a doctor, the life of a programmer is zen-like.

I have a wristwatch that constantly measures my pulse, and when I’m at work it’s usually in the low 50s to 40s, which is about as low as it gets. I sometimes have a higher pulse when I’m sleeping.

Back home I have a wife and three kids. Nothing relaxing about that. Vacation is probably the most stressful part of my life. When I need to chill out, I go to work.
