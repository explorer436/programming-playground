When preparing for software engineering interviews why is CodeChef not as popular as LeetCode?

LeetCode is more popular because it’s focused on interview prep, while CodeChef is more focused on competitive programming.

To be more specific, LeetCode’s questions are usually slightly easier compared to CodeChef’s, and they’re designed to be as close to what you’d see in your technical interviews as possible. On the other hand, CodeChef’s questions are purposefully harder to better accommodate for its emphasis on competitive programming—it’s still a useful tool for learning more about data structures & algorithms, but it’s not optimized for interview preparation like LeetCode is.

Still, both sites neglect to cover a key component of software engineering interviews: soft skills. Despite what most programmers believe, every big tech recruiter is looking for a suite of non-technical skills—skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership—on top of the coding skills you’d expect. Failing to demonstrate that you have these soft skills is a surefire way to get overlooked, so given that you’re preparing for an interview, you may want to look into some other resources to help you out with this.

One resource you may want to check out is Tech Interview Pro
, an interview prep course designed by a former Google software engineer. TIP includes over 20 hours of in-depth video content on both the technical and non-technical aspects of big tech interviews, and the founder holds bi-weekly Q&A sessions to answer your specific questions. There’s also Interviewing.io , where you can do mock interviews with other software engineers and get immediate feedback on your performance. Both tools will be helpful in developing the soft skills you need to perform well in your interviews.

To summarize, LeetCode is more popular than CodeChef because programmers are (on the whole) more interested in preparing for job interviews than they are in competitive programming. But to ensure your success in those interviews, you probably want to leverage a few other resources as well. Best of luck.
