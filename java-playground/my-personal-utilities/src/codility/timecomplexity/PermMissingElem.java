Find the missing element in a given permutation.



    An array A consisting of N different integers is given. 
    The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], 
    which means that exactly one element is missing.
    
    Your goal is to find that missing element.
    
    Write a function:
    
        class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
    
    that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.
    
    For example, given array A such that:
      A[0] = 2
      A[1] = 3
      A[2] = 1
      A[3] = 5
    
    the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
    
    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    
            N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
            the elements of A are all distinct;
            each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
