	Arithmetic expression evaluation:
	
	As another example of a stack client, we consider
	a classic example that also demonstrates the utility of generics. Some of the 
	programs that we considered involved computing the value of arithmetic
	expressions like this one:
	( 1 + ( ( 2 + 3 ) * ( 4 * 5 ) ) )
	
	If you multiply 4 by 5 , add 3 to 2 , multiply the result, and then add 1 , you get the value 101.
	But how does the Java system do this calculation? Without going into the details of
	how the Java system is built, we can address the essential ideas by writing a Java program
	that can take a string as input (the expression) and produce the number represented by
	the expression as output. For simplicity, we begin with the following explicit recursive
	definition: an arithmetic expression is either a number, or a left parenthesis followed by
	an arithmetic expression followed by an operator followed by another arithmetic ex-
	pression followed by a right parenthesis. For simplicity, this definition is for fully paren-
	thesized arithmetic expressions, which specify precisely which operators apply to which
	operands—you are a bit more familiar with expressions such as 1 + 2 * 3 , where we
	often rely on precedence rules instead of parentheses. The same basic mechanisms that
	we consider can handle precedence rules, but we avoid that complication. For speci-
	ficity, we support the familiar binary operators * , + , - , and / , as well as a square-root
	operator sqrt that takes just one argument. We could easily allow more operators and
	more kinds of operators to embrace a large class of familiar mathematical expressions,
	involving trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Our focus is on un-
	derstanding how to interpret the string of parentheses, operators, and numbers to en-
	able performing in the proper order the low-level arithmetic operations that are avail-
	able on any computer. Precisely how can we convert an arithmetic expression—a string
	of characters—to the value that it represents? A remarkably simple algorithm that was
	developed by E. W. Dijkstra in the 1960s uses two stacks (one for operands and one for
	operators) to do this job. An expression consists of parentheses, operators, and oper-
	ands (numbers). Proceeding from left to right and taking these entities one at a time,
	we manipulate the stacks according to four possible cases, as follows:
	
	■ Push operands onto the operand stack.
	■ Push operators onto the operator stack.
	■ Ignore left parentheses.
	■ On encountering a right parenthesis, pop an operator, pop the requisite number
	of operands, and push onto the operand stack the result of applying that opera-
	tor to those operands.
	
	After the final right parenthesis has been processed, there is one value on the stack,
	which is the value of the expression. This method may seem mysterious at first, but it
	is easy to convince yourself that it computes the proper value: any time the algorithm
	encounters a subexpression consisting of two operands separated by an operator, all
	surrounded by parentheses, it leaves the result of performing that operation on those
	operands on the operand stack. The result is the same as if that value had appeared in
	the input instead of the subexpression, so we can think of replacing the subexpression
	by the value to get an expression that would yield the same result. We can apply this
	argument again and again until we get a single value. For example, the algorithm com-
	putes the same value for all of these expressions:
	( 1 + ( (2 + 3 ) * ( 4 * 5 ) ) )
	( 1 + ( 5 * ( 4 * 5 ) ) )
	( 1 + ( 5 * 20 ) )
	( 1 + 100 )
	101
	
	FullyParenthesizedArithmeticExpressionEvaluation.java is an implementation of this algorithm. This code is a
	simple example of an interpreter: a program that interprets the computation specified
	by a given string and performs the computation to arrive at the result.
