    BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH / LEVEL ORDER
    
    Trees can also be traversed in level-order, where we visit every node on a level before going to a lower level.
    This search is referred to as breadth-first search (BFS), as the search tree is broadened as much as possible on each depth before going to the next depth.

    LEVELORDERTRAVERSALOFBINARYTREE:
    
    Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:
    
    Given the root of a binary tree, print its level-order traversal. For example:
    
      1
     / \
    2   3
       / \
      4   5
    
    
    The following tree should output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    
    class Node:
      def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
    
    def print_level_order(root):
      # Fill this in.
    
    root = Node(1, Node(2), Node(3, Node(4), Node(5)))
    print_level_order(root)
    # 1 2 3 4 5

    (Easy)

    Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

    This problem was asked by Microsoft.

    Print the nodes in a binary tree level-wise. 
    For example, the following should print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

      1
    / \
    2   3
      / \
      4   5
