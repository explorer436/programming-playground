    What the hell is going on? Can I print the value of this variable?

    You have been explicitly forbidden to write output to the terminal - GHCi will automtically print the return value of your function. 
    There is a reason for doing this, which we will cover later. 
    However, if, for debugging you need to print values to the terminal use various functions from the Debug.Trace module.
    
    For example, here’s how you can use traceShow to print the values passed to your lambda, while summing a list of itnegers:
    
    GHCi> import Debug.Trace (traceShow)
    GHCi> import Data.List (foldl')
    GHCi> foldl' (\total x -> traceShow (total, x) (total + x)) 0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    The simplified type-signature of traceShow is:
    
    traceShow :: a -> b -> b
    You can pass it two arguments of any type, it will print the first argument to the console, and will return the second argument as it is. 
    Which means that traceShow will always evaluate to the second argument passed to it. 
    So, in our example above (total, x) is being printed, but the function call to traceShow is evaluating to total + x; and, as a result, the entire lambda is evaluating to total + x – thus our summation logic is not changing. 
    In other words, (total, x), which is being printed has absolutely no effect on the “return value” of traceShow. 
    The “return value” of traceShow will always be the second argument you pass to it.
