 This approach is ubiquitous in functional languages and is often referred to as a monadic design pattern.

	   The thenCompose method, together with thenApply, implement basic building blocks of the monadic pattern.
	   They closely relate to the map and flatMap methods of Stream and Optional classes that are available in Java 8.

	   Both methods receive a function and apply it to the computation result, but the thenCompose (flatMap) method receives a function that returns another object of the same type.
	   This functional structure allows composing the instances of these classes as building blocks.

        // SEQUENTIAL
        // We use the thenCompose method to chain two Futures sequentially.
        // This method takes a function that returns a CompletableFuture instance.
        // The argument of this function is the result of the previous computation step.
        // This allows us to use this value inside the next CompletableFuture‘s lambda.

        System.out.println(completableFuture01.get());
        // Hello World


        // PARALLEL
        // If we want to execute two independent Futures and do something with their results after both are complete,
        // we can use the thenCombine method that accepts a Future and a Function with two arguments to process both results:
        CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture02 = classUnderTest.calculateHelloAsync().thenCombine(classUnderTest.calculateWorldAsync(), (s1, s2) -> s1 + s2);
        System.out.println(completableFuture02.get());
        // Hello World

        // Another example:
        System.out.println("Calculating BMI.");
        CompletableFuture<Double> bmiFuture = classUnderTest.getWeightInKg()
                .thenCombine(classUnderTest.getHeightInCm(), (weightInKg, heightInCm) -> {
                    Double heightInMeter = heightInCm/100;
                    return weightInKg/(heightInMeter*heightInMeter);
                });
        System.out.println("Your BMI is - " + bmiFuture.get()); // Your BMI is - 20.56126561232714


        // A simpler case is when we want to do something with two Futures‘ results, but don't need to pass any resulting value down a Future chain.
        // The thenAcceptBoth method is there to help.
        CompletableFuture completableFuture03 = classUnderTest.calculateHelloAsync().thenAcceptBoth(classUnderTest.calculateWorldAsync(), (s1, s2) -> System.out.println(s1 + s2));
        // Hello World
        System.out.println(completableFuture03.get()); // null
