    Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
    
    (Easy)
    
    This problem was asked by Google.
    
    A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.
    
    Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.
    
    For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:
    
       0
      / \
     1   0
        / \
       1   0
      / \
     1   1

    Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:
    
    A unival tree is a tree where all the nodes have the same value. Given a binary tree, return the number of unival subtrees in the tree.
    
    For example, the following tree should return 5:
    
       0
      / \
     1   0
        / \
       1   0
      / \
     1   1
    
    
    The 5 trees are:
    - The three single '1' leaf nodes. (+3)
    - The single '0' leaf node. (+1)
    - The [1, 1, 1] tree at the bottom. (+1)
    
    Here's a starting point:
    
    class Node(object):
      def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
    
    def count_unival_subtrees(root):
      # Fill this in.
    
    a = Node(0)
    a.left = Node(1)
    a.right = Node(0)
    a.right.left = Node(1)
    a.right.right = Node(0)
    a.right.left.left = Node(1)
    a.right.left.right = Node(1)
    
    print count_unival_subtrees(a)
    # 5

        isAEqualToLeftNodeValue = case (rootValue left) of 
                                     Just value -> (a == value)  
                                     Nothing -> False

-- testIsUnival01 = isUnival EmptyTree -- False. This seems to be working when tested from the ghci interpreter.

countUnivalSubtrees EmptyTree                    = 0
countUnivalSubtrees (Node a EmptyTree EmptyTree) = 1
countUnivalSubtrees tree@(Node a left right) 
    | isUnival tree == True                               = 1 + countUnivalSubtrees left + countUnivalSubtrees right
    | isUnival tree /= True                               = countUnivalSubtrees left + countUnivalSubtrees right
