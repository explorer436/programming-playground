What is bad code?

How would you identify that you are writing bad code or tell someone that they are writing bad code?

You don’t because it isn’t bad.

It might be logically flawed, stylistically at odds with team standards, not performant, inelegant, too verbose, too terse, not readable, poorly named, or fragile. It might follow anti-patterns, be untestable or contrary to architectural standards, violate language idioms, break tests, introduce regressions, confuse team-mates, or be poorly documented. It might recreate existing library functions, abuse third party APIs, cost far too much to run, or use language features which are already at end of life. It might create tech debt and make iteration more difficult. Their code might start a revolution.

Tell them any of that or whatever else might be true of their code but don’t just say it’s bad. Doing so shows a lack of technical depth and imagination. Do better by your colleagues.
