* Notes

For quick reference, here's what we're going to be making:

1. A Bad Singly-Linked Stack
1. An Ok Singly-Linked Stack
1. A Persistent Singly-Linked Stack
1. A Bad But Safe Doubly-Linked Deque
1. An Unsafe Singly-Linked Queue
1. TODO: An Ok Unsafe Doubly-Linked Deque
1. Bonus: A Bunch of Silly Lists

Creating the project:

#+begin_src 
cargo new --lib linked-lists
cd linked-lists
#+end_src
