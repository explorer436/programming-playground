* How was this created?

Using the commands from https://create-react-app.dev/

* Gotchas

1. npm install wouldn't work and npm start wouldn't work.
2. I used ~yarn install~ to force install the necessary dependencies.
3. After that, everything seems to work ok.
4. The application starts ok.
5. No other changes were made to it after that.
