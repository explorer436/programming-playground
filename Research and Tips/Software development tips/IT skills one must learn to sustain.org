What are the IT skills one must learn by 2025 to sustain in the field?

IT landscape are changing year on year so whats the trend on 2019 (as 2020 has just started) may not relevant in 2025 but below are some skills that will have a bright future

1. Cloud: This is a hot skill now. More and more companies are moving to cloud to optimize cost. Big Shots like Amazon, Microsoft, Google are investing lot of money in Cloud. Cloud architects, developers has a long promising career.
1. Data Science: This is another hot skills now a days. Applications are huge, from fraud detection, potential market, Politics, consumer sentiment to prescribe a medicine to a patient everywhere data science are applied. This is a great skill that is going to benefit everybody.
1. BIG Data: Yes, relational database era was gone. No body wants to keep normalized structured data anymore, now time for unstructured data. Now a days companies are taking huge data from social media, mobile apps, govt, IOT, Stock Exchange etc. So keeping such a large volume of data with a high performance, its not something RDBMS can provide so NO SQL is the answer. This skill is quite sometime in industry but it will be always on demand.
1. Web Development: This is a old skill but always required. Technology landscape has evolve a lot but its still a hot skill. Relatively easy to learn and if you spend time on this and keep yourself updated, your cv will be always on demand.
1. Hybrid Apps Development: Yes future is mobile, no doubt about it. Companies dont spend money on hiring separate developers for IOS and Android, Now they hire hybrid apps developers. So if you learn hybrid apps development tools like React Native, Flutter, Nativescript etc, you will be always on demand. This skill has lot of potential and i dont see any downfall in next 5 years.

These mentioned skills are hot skills now days, however legacy systems are not going to decommission immediately. All skills will be required but if you want a fat CTC then you cant deny these skills.
