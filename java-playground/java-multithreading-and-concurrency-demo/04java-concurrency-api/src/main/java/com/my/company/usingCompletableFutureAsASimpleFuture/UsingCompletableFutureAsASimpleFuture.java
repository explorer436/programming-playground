		First of all, the CompletableFuture class implements the Future interface. So, we can use it as a Future implementation, but with additional completion logic.	

		For example, we can create an instance of this class with a no-arg constructor to represent some future result, hand it out to the consumers, and complete it at some time in the future using the complete method. 
		The consumers may use the get method to block the current thread until this result is provided.

	    If we already know the result of a computation, we can use the static completedFuture method with an argument that represents a result of this computation. 
	    Consequently, the get method of the Future will never block, immediately returning this result instead:
