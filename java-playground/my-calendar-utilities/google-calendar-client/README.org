The application was able to read the events successfully but it wasn't able to delete events. 
It was throwing a 403 error. Maybe, I didn't set up the OAuth credentials right.

Result:
I did not end up using this application.
I wrote separate applications for 
1. converting ics file to json files
2. update Google Calender using a python script that uses REST calls.
