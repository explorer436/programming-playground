Why are we not using PaymentEventProcessorConfig and InventoryEventProcessorConfig?

1. There is a log of repetitive code
2. If we use them, we have to create bindings for them in the yaml file. But for all of them, the message is essentially going to the same topic.
   e.g.
   #+begin_src 
   spring:
     cloud:
       function:
         definition: orderEventProducer;paymentProcessor;inventoryProcessor;shippingProcessor
       stream:
         bindings:
           orderEventProducer-out-0:
             destination: order-events
           paymentProcessor-out-0:
             destination: order-events
           inventoryProcessor-out-0:
             destination: order-events
   #+end_src

The approach will work. But we can refactor and minimize the configuration.
We do that using AbstractOrderEventRouterConfig and ProcessorConfig.
