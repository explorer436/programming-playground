* Use case

[[./Screenshot_2024-08-23_15-04-54.png]]

1. ~product-service~
   1. Users use this service to view products (GET operation).
   1. Everytime it handles a request, it emits an event to a kafka topic
1. ~analytics-service~
   1. Consumes the events emitted by ~product-service~
   1. Keeps track of the metrics using a table in a database (keeps incrementing the count column in the table)
   1. Has a GET (streaming) endpoint to show metrics (using data from the table). It will be emitting data every 3 seconds. Gives the top 5 products based on view count from the table.
   1. Generates analytics reports based on the events

* Testing

1. Start the two applications
1. Launch http://localhost:7070/ in a browser tab
1. Launch http://localhost:8080/ in another browser tab (http://localhost:8080/index.html if that doesn't work)
1. Start selecting products in the ~Product Service~ tab
1. We should see that the results in the analytics tab are updated real time.
