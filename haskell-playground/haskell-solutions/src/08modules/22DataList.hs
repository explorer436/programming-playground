import Data.List

-- https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/Data-List.html

-- The Data.List module is all about lists, obviously.
-- It provides some very useful functions for dealing with them.
-- We've already met some of its functions (like map and filter) 
-- because the Prelude module exports some functions from Data.List for convenience.
-- You don't have to import Data.List via a qualified import 
-- because it doesn't clash with any Prelude names 
-- except for those that Prelude already steals from Data.List.
-- Let's take a look at some of the functions that we haven't met before.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- intersperse takes an element and a list 
-- and then puts that element in between each pair of elements in the list.
-- Here's a demonstration:

testIntersperse01 = intersperse '.' "MONKEY"  
-- "M.O.N.K.E.Y"  

testIntersperse02 = intersperse 0 [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
-- [1,0,2,0,3,0,4,0,5,0,6]  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- intercalate takes a list of lists and a list. 
-- It then inserts that list in between all those lists and then flattens the result.

testIntercalate01 = intercalate " " ["hey","there","guys"]  
--"hey there guys"  

testIntercalate02 = intercalate [0,0,0] [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]  
-- [1,2,3,0,0,0,4,5,6,0,0,0,7,8,9]  

------------------------------------------------------------------------


-- transpose transposes a list of lists.
-- If you look at a list of lists as a 2D matrix, the columns become the rows and vice versa.

testTranspose01 = transpose [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]  
-- [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]  

testTranspose02 = transpose ["hey","there","guys"]  
-- ["htg","ehu","yey","rs","e"] 

-- Say we have the polynomials 3x2 + 5x + 9, 10x3 + 9 and 8x3 + 5x2 + x - 1 
-- and we want to add them together. 
-- We can use the lists [0,3,5,9], [10,0,0,9] and [8,5,1,-1] to represent them in Haskell. 
-- Now, to add them, all we have to do is this:
testMapSumTranspose03 = map sum $ transpose [[0,3,5,9],[10,0,0,9],[8,5,1,-1]]  
-- [18,8,6,17]  
-- When we transpose these three lists, 
-- the third powers are then in the first row, 
-- the second powers in the second one and so on. 
-- Mapping sum to that produces our desired result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- foldl' and foldl1' are stricter versions of their respective lazy incarnations. 
-- When using lazy folds on really big lists, you might often get a stack overflow error. 
-- The culprit for that is that due to the lazy nature of the folds, 
-- the accumulator value isn't actually updated as the folding happens. 
-- What actually happens is that the accumulator kind of makes a promise 
-- that it will compute its value when asked to actually produce the result (also called a thunk). 
-- That happens for every intermediate accumulator and all those thunks overflow your stack. 
-- The strict folds aren't lazy buggers 
-- and actually compute the intermediate values as they go along 
-- instead of filling up your stack with thunks.
-- So if you ever get stack overflow errors when doing lazy folds, 
-- try switching to their strict versions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- concat flattens a list of lists into just a list of elements.

testConcat01 = concat ["foo","bar","car"]  
-- "foobarcar"  

testConcat02 = concat [[3,4,5],[2,3,4],[2,1,1]]  
-- [3,4,5,2,3,4,2,1,1]  

-- It will just remove one level of nesting.
-- So if you want to completely flatten [[[2,3],[3,4,5],[2]],[[2,3],[3,4]]], 
-- which is a list of lists of lists, you have to concatenate it twice.

testConcat03 = concat [[[2,3],[3,4,5],[2]],[[2,3],[3,4]]]
-- [[2,3],[3,4,5],[2],[2,3],[3,4]]
testConcat04 = concat $ concat [[[2,3],[3,4,5],[2]],[[2,3],[3,4]]]
-- [2,3,3,4,5,2,2,3,3,4]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Doing concatMap is the same as first mapping a function to a list 
-- and then concatenating the list with concat.

testConcatMap01 = concatMap (replicate 4) [1..3]  
-- [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3]  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- `and` takes a list of boolean values 
-- and returns True only if all the values in the list are True.

testAnd01 = and $ map (>4) [5,6,7,8]  
-- True  

testAnd02 = and $ map (==4) [4,4,4,3,4]  
-- False  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- or is like and, only it returns True if any of the boolean values in a list is True.

testOr01 = or $ map (==4) [2,3,4,5,6,1]  
-- True  

testOr02 = or $ map (>4) [1,2,3]  
-- False 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- any and all take a predicate 
-- and then check if any or all the elements in a list satisfy the predicate, respectively. 
-- Usually we use these two functions instead of mapping over a list and then doing and or or.

testAny01 =  any (==4) [2,3,5,6,1,4]  
-- True  
testAny02 =  any (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "HEYGUYSwhatsup"

-- True  
testAll02 =  all (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "HEYGUYSwhatsup"  
-- False  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- iterate takes a function and a starting value. 
-- It applies the function to the starting value,
-- then it applies that function to the result,
-- then it applies the function to that result again, etc.
-- It returns all the results in the form of an infinite list.

testIterate01 = take 10 $ iterate (*2) 1  
-- [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512]  

testIterate02 = take 3 $ iterate (++ "haha") "haha"  
-- ["haha","hahahaha","hahahahahaha"] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- splitAt takes a number and a list. 
-- It then splits the list at that many elements, returning the resulting two lists in a tuple.

testSplitAt01 = splitAt 2 "heyman"  
-- ("he","yman")  
testSplitAt02 = splitAt 100 "heyman"  
-- ("heyman","")  
testSplitAt03 = splitAt (-3) "heyman"  
-- ("","heyman")  
testSplitAt04 = 
    let (a,b) = splitAt 3 "foobar" 
        in b ++ a  
-- "barfoo" 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- takeWhile is a really useful little function.
-- It takes elements from a list while the predicate holds 
-- and then when an element is encountered that doesn't satisfy the predicate, it is cut off.
-- It turns out this is very useful.

testTakeWhile01 = takeWhile (>3) [6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1]  
-- [6,5,4] 
testTakeWhile02 = takeWhile (>3) [6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,6,5,4]  
-- [6,5,4]  
testTakeWhile03 = takeWhile (/=' ') "This is a sentence"  
-- "This"  

-- Say we wanted to know the sum of all third powers that are under 10,000.
-- We can't map (^3) to [1..], apply a filter and then try to sum that up 
-- because filtering an infinite list never finishes.
-- You may know that all the elements here are ascending but Haskell doesn't.
-- That's why we can do this:

testTakeWhile04 = sum $ takeWhile (<10000) $ map (^3) [1..]  
-- 53361  

-- We apply (^3) to an infinite list and then once an element that's over 10,000 is encountered,
-- the list is cut off. Now we can sum it up easily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- dropWhile is similar, only it drops all the elements while the predicate is true.
-- Once predicate equates to False, it returns the rest of the list.
-- An extremely useful and lovely function!

testDropWhile01 = dropWhile (/=' ') "This is a sentence"  
-- " is a sentence"  

testDropWhile02 = dropWhile (<3) [1,2,2,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1]  
-- [3,4,5,4,3,2,1]  


-- We are given a list that represents the value of a stock by date.
-- The list is made of tuples whose first component is the stock value,

-- We want to know when the stock value first exceeded one thousand dollars!
stock = [(994.4,2008,9,1),(995.2,2008,9,2),(999.2,2008,9,3),(1001.4,2008,9,4),(998.3,2008,9,5)]

-- span is kind of like takeWhile, only it returns a pair of lists.
-- The first list contains everything the resulting list from takeWhile would contain 
-- if it were called with the same predicate and the same list. 
-- The second list contains the part of the list that would have been dropped.

testSpan01 = 
    let (fw, rest) = span (/=' ') "This is a sentence" 
        in "First word:" ++ fw ++ ", the rest:" ++ rest  
-- "First word: This, the rest: is a sentence"  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Whereas span spans the list while the predicate is true, 
-- break breaks it when the predicate is first true. 
-- Doing break p is the equivalent of doing span (not . p).

testBreak01 = break (==4) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

testBreak02 = span (/=4) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  
-- ([1,2,3],[4,5,6,7])  

-- When using break, the second list in the result will start with the first element that satisfies the predicate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- sort simply sorts a list. 
-- The type of the elements in the list has to be part of the Ord typeclass,

-- [[1,1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[3,3],[2,2,2],[5],[6],[7]]

-- If we sort a list before grouping it, 
-- we can find out how many times each element appears in the list.

testGroup02 = 
    map (\l@(x:xs) -> (x,length l)) . group . sort $ [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,5,6,7]  
-- [(1,4),(2,7),(3,2),(5,1),(6,1),(7,1)] 


-- TODO print the number that occurs the most number of times.
-- In the above example, it should print 2.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- inits and tails are like init and tail, only they recursively apply that to a list until there's nothing left. Observe.

testInits01 = inits "w00t"

-- Let's use a fold to implement searching a list for a sublist.

search needle haystack =   
    let needleLength = length needle  
    in  foldl (\acc x -> if take needleLength x == needle then True else acc) False (tails haystack)  

-- First we call tails with the list in which we're searching.
-- Then we go over each tail and see if it starts with what we're looking for.

-- With that, we actually just made a function that behaves like isInfixOf.
-- isInfixOf searches for a sublist within a list 
-- and returns True if the sublist we're looking for is somewhere inside the target list.

testIsInfixOf01 = "cat" `isInfixOf` "im a cat burglar"  
-- True  
testIsInfixOf02 = "Cat" `isInfixOf` "im a cat burglar"

testPartition02 = partition (>3) [1,3,5,6,3,2,1,0,3,7]  
-- ([5,6,7],[1,3,3,2,1,0,3])  

-- It's important to understand how this is different from span and break:

testSpan02 = span (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "BOBsidneyMORGANeddy"  
-- ("BOB","sidneyMORGANeddy")  

-- While span and break are done once they encounter 
-- the first element that doesn't and does satisfy the predicate,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- We already covered zip and zipWith. 
-- We noted that they zip together two lists,
-- either in a tuple or with a binary function (meaning such a function that takes two parameters).
-- But what if we want to zip together three lists? 
-- Or zip three lists with a function that takes three parameters? 
-- Well, for that, we have zip3, zip4, etc. and zipWith3, zipWith4, etc.
-- These variants go up to 7. 
-- While this may look like a hack, it works out pretty fine, 
-- because there aren't many times when you want to zip 8 lists together.
-- There's also a very clever way for zipping infinite numbers of lists,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- We've already mentioned nub. 
-- It takes a list and weeds out the duplicate elements, 
-- returning a list whose every element is a unique snowflake! 
-- The function does have a kind of strange name. 
-- It turns out that "nub" means a small lump or essential part of something. 
-- In my opinion, they should use real words for function names instead of old-people words.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- union also acts like a function on sets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- insert takes an element 
-- and a list of elements that can be sorted 
-- and inserts it into the last position 
-- where it's still less than or equal to the next element. 
-- In other words, insert will start at the beginning of the list 
-- and then keep going until it finds an element that's equal to or greater than 
-- the element that we're inserting and it will insert it just before the element.

testInsert01 = insert 4 [3,5,1,2,8,2]  
-- [3,4,5,1,2,8,2]  
testInsert02 = insert 4 [1,3,4,4,1]  
-- [1,3,4,4,4,1]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What length, take, drop, splitAt, !! and replicate have in common 
-- is that they take an Int as one of their parameters (or return an Int), 
-- even though they could be more generic and usable 
-- if they just took any type that's part of the Integral or Num typeclasses 
-- (depending on the functions).
-- They do that for historical reasons.
-- However, fixing that would probably break a lot of existing code.
-- That's why Data.List has their more generic equivalents,
-- named genericLength, genericTake, genericDrop, genericSplitAt, genericIndex and genericReplicate.
-- For instance, length has a type signature of length :: [a] -> Int.
-- If we try to get the average of a list of numbers by doing let xs = [1..6] in sum xs / length xs,
-- we get a type error, because you can't use / with an Int.
-- genericLength, on the other hand, has a type signature of genericLength :: (Num a) => [b] -> a.
-- Because a Num can act like a floating point number,
-- getting the average by doing let xs = [1..6] in sum xs / genericLength xs works out just fine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


-- The nub, delete, union, intersect and group functions 
-- all have their more general counterparts called 
-- nubBy, deleteBy, unionBy, intersectBy and groupBy. 
-- The difference between them is that the first set of functions use == to test for equality, 
-- whereas the By ones also take an equality function 
-- and then compare them by using that equality function. 
-- group is the same as groupBy (==).

-- For instance, say we have a list that describes the value of a function for every second. 
-- We want to segment it into sublists based on when the value was below zero 
-- and when it went above. 
-- If we just did a normal group, it would just group the equal adjacent values together. 
-- But what we want is to group them by whether they are negative or not. 
-- That's where groupBy comes in! 
-- The equality function supplied to the By functions should take two elements of the same type 
-- and return True if it considers them equal by its standards.

values = [-4.3, -2.4, -1.2, 0.4, 2.3, 5.9, 10.5, 29.1, 5.3, -2.4, -14.5, 2.9, 2.3]  
testGroupBy01 = groupBy (\x y -> (x > 0) == (y > 0)) values  
-- [[-4.3,-2.4,-1.2],[0.4,2.3,5.9,10.5,29.1,5.3],[-2.4,-14.5],[2.9,2.3]]  


-- From this, we clearly see which sections are positive and which are negative. 
-- The equality function supplied takes two elements 
-- and then returns True only if they're both negative or if they're both positive. 
-- This equality function can also be written as 
-- \x y -> (x > 0) && (y > 0) || (x <= 0) && (y <= 0), 
-- although I think the first way is more readable. 
-- An even clearer way to write equality functions for the By functions is 
-- if you import the on function from Data.Function. on is defined like this:

on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c  
f `on` g = \x y -> f (g x) (g y)  
-- So doing (==) `on` (> 0) returns 
-- an equality function that looks like \x y -> (x > 0) == (y > 0). 
-- `on` is used a lot with the `By` functions because with it, we can do:

testGroupByOn01 = groupBy ((==) `on` (> 0)) values  
-- [[-4.3,-2.4,-1.2],[0.4,2.3,5.9,10.5,29.1,5.3],[-2.4,-14.5],[2.9,2.3]]  
-- Very readable indeed! 
-- You can read it out loud: 
-- Group this by equality on whether the elements are greater than zero.


-- Similarly, the sort, insert, maximum and minimum also have their more general equivalents. 
-- Functions like groupBy take a function that determines when two elements are equal. 
-- sortBy, insertBy, maximumBy and minimumBy take a function that determine if 
-- one element is greater, smaller or equal to the other. 
-- The type signature of sortBy is sortBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]. 
-- If you remember from before, the Ordering type can have a value of LT, EQ or GT. 
-- sort is the equivalent of sortBy compare, 
-- because compare just takes two elements whose type is in the Ord typeclass and 
-- returns their ordering relationship.

-- Lists can be compared, but when they are, they are compared lexicographically.
-- What if we have a list of lists and we want to sort it not based on the inner lists' contents 
-- but on their lengths? Well, as you've probably guessed, we'll use the sortBy function.

testSortBy01 = sortBy (compare `on` length) [[5,4,5,4,4],[1,2,3],[3,5,4,3],[],[2],[2,2]]  
-- [[],[2],[2,2],[1,2,3],[3,5,4,3],[5,4,5,4,4]]  

-- Awesome! compare `on` length ... man, 
-- that reads almost like real English! 
-- If you're not sure how exactly the `on` works here, 
-- compare `on` length is the equivalent of \x y -> length x `compare` length y.
-- When you're dealing with `By` functions that take an equality function,
-- you usually do (==) `on` something 
-- and when you're dealing with `By` functions that take an ordering function,
-- you usually do compare `on` something.
