** Is there a way to configure openapi-generator to use jakarta (instead of javax) package during generation

#+begin_src
configOptions = [
	    useSpringBoot3: "true"
	]
#+end_src
But this option works only for the SPRING generator openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/spring, which generates the server.

The property that you need is either "useSpringBoot3" or "useJakartaEe"

    Go to https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-maven-plugin

    At the end of the table you see "configHelp" property which will give you configs for the current generator "spring" in my case

    Rerun "mvn clean install" - this will give you a list of available "configOptions".

    Read the list and found a property

    useJakartaEe: whether to use Jakarta EE namespace instead of javax (Default: false)
