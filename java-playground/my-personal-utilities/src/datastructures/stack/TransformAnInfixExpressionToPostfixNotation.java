/**
 * 
	We often deal with arithmetic expressions written in what is called infix notation: (Operand1 op Operand2)

    We have rules to indicate which operations take precedence over others, and we often use parentheses to override those rules.
    
    It is also quite possible to write arithmetic expressions using postfix notation: (Operand1 Operand2 op)
    
    With postfix notation, it is possible to use a stack to find the overall value of an infix expression by first converting it to postfix notation.
    
    Example: Suppose we have this infix expression I: 5 * ( 6 + 2 ) - 12 / 4
    
    The equivalent postfix expression P is: 5 6 2 + * 12 4 / -
    
    This discussion assumes all our operations are binary operations (2 arguments each). Notice that we also sometimes use unary operations such as ++ or -- or the unary + and -.
    
    We are not including the possibility of array elements in this discussion. (The subscript can be an expression which would have to be evaluated.)
    
    One way to think of an expression is as a list or sequence of items, each of which is a left parenthesis, right parenthesis, argument, or operator. An argument can be a constant or the name of a variable. Presumably it would be necessary at some point to replace each variable with its value.
    
    There are two algorithms involved. One converts an infix expression to postfix form, and the other evaluates a postfix expression. Each uses a stack.

		Suppose I is an arithmetic expression in infix notation.
		We will create an equivalent postfix expression P by adding items to on the right of P.
		The new expression P will not contain any parentheses.

		We will use a stack in which each item may be a left parenthesis or the symbol for an operation.
		
		     Start with an empty stack.  We scan I from left to right. 
		
		     While (we have not reached the end of I)
		        If (an operand is found)
		           Add it to P
		        End-If
		        If (a left parenthesis is found) 
		           Push it onto the stack
		        End-If
		        If (a right parenthesis is found) 
		           While (the stack is not empty AND the top item is not a left parenthesis)
		              Pop the stack and add the popped value to P
		           End-While
		           Pop the left parenthesis from the stack and discard it
		        End-If
		        If (an operator is found)
		           If (the stack is empty or if the top element is a left parenthesis)
		              Push the operator onto the stack
		           Else  
		              While (the stack is not empty AND the top of the stack 
		                     is not a left parenthesis AND precedence of the                  
		                     operator <= precedence of the top of the stack)
		                 Pop the stack and add the top value to P
		              End-While
		              Push the latest operator onto the stack     
		           End-If  
		        End-If
		     End-While
		     While (the stack is not empty)
		        Pop the stack and add the popped value to P
		     End-While
		
		Notes:
		
		    At the end, if there is still a left parenthesis at the top of the stack, 
		    or if we find a right parenthesis when the stack is empty, 
		    then I contained unbalanced parentheses and is in error.
