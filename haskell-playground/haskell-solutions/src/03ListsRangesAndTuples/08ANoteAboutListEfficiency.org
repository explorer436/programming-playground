A Note About List Efficiency

You might be thinking that this way of finding something is very inefficient. 
You’d be correct if you were thinking this! 

For small amounts of data, the list type is very handy and useful, and more than efficient enough. 
However, for much larger amounts of data, we would want to use different functions and types if we wanted things to be fast and efficient. 
As with everything, the context gives meaning to the content, so as the content changes (you get a bigger set of data), we must choose different ways of working with it (choose a different context of functions and data types).

Lists are very good for certain things, such as for representing data that is added to at the front. 
They are also quite easy to write code for, so they’re good for beginners to look at first.
As you learn programming more you’ll start to get an appreciation and understanding of the different types for storing data, and when it’s good to use each.
