With this assignment strategy, this is how the partition assignment to Consumers is done:

When we have only Consumer1 in the ConsumerGroup:
Consumer1 -> partition0, partition1, partition2

When we have Consumer1 and Consumer2 in the ConsumerGroup:
Consumer1 -> partition0, partition1
Consumer2 -> partition2

When we have Consumer1, Consumer2 and Consumer3 in the ConsumerGroup:
Consumer1 -> partition0
Consumer2 -> partition2
Consumer3 -> partition1
