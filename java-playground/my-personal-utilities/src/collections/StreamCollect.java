	 * The Stream.collect Method
	 * 
	 * Unlike the reduce method, which always creates a new value when it processes an element,

	 * 
	 * Consider how to find the average of values in a stream. 
	 * You require two pieces of data: the total number of values and the sum of those values. 
	 * However, like the reduce method and all other reduction methods, the collect method returns only one value. 
	 * You can create a new data type that contains member variables that keep track of the total number of values and the sum of those values, such as the class, Averager:

		 * The collect operation in this example takes three arguments:
		 * 
		 * 1. supplier: 
		 *    The supplier is a factory function; it constructs new instances. 
		 *    For the collect operation, it creates instances of the result container. 
		 *    In this example, it is a new instance of the Averager class.
		 *    This is where the accumulated value will be stored.
		 *    
		 * 2. accumulator: 
		 *    The accumulator function incorporates a stream element into a result container. 
		 *    In this example, it modifies the Averager result container by incrementing the count variable by one and 
		 *    adding to the total member variable the value of the stream element, which is an integer representing the age of a male member.
		 *    Accumulating the elements - We need to create a function that defines how weâ€™ll add an element to the result container.
		 *    It doesnâ€™t return anything. It just updates the result container (in this case, Averager) in a mutable way.
		 * 
		 * 3. combiner: 
		 *    The combiner function takes two result containers and merges their contents. 
		 *    In this example, it modifies an Averager result container by incrementing the count variable by the count member variable of the other Averager instance and 
		 *    adding to the total member variable the value of the other Averager instance's total member variable.
		 *    
		 *    This is for combining two partial results.
		 *    In a sequential reduction the supplier and accumulator above would be sufficient. But to be able to support a parallel implementation we need to provide a combiner.
		 *    
		 *    The combiner is a function that defines how two result containers could be combined.
		 *    
		 *    Why?
		 *    
		 *    Because in a parallel scenario our stream would be split into partitions where each partition would be accumulated in parallel. When finished, the results would be merged using our combiner function.
		 *    
		 * 
		 * Note the following:
		 * 
		 * The supplier is a lambda expression (or a method reference) as opposed to a value like the identity element in the reduce operation.
		 * 
		 * The accumulator and combiner functions do not return a value.
		 * 
		 * You can use the collect operations with parallel streams; 
		 * see the section Parallelism for more information. 
		 * (If you run the collect method with a parallel stream, then the JDK creates a new thread whenever the combiner function creates a new object, such as an Averager object in this example. 
		 * Consequently, you do not have to worry about synchronization.)
