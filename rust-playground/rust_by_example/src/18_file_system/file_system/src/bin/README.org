The walkdir approach iterates through all files. When it finds a matching file, it gets its parent directory and adds it to a HashSet (to avoid duplicates). This is a slightly different way to think about it but achieves the same result. The custom recursive solution is arguably more efficient for this specific task as it can stop checking files in a directory once one is found and only then recurse.
