- local images (public folder) - less performant
- save image (Save Image As....)
- create images folder in public
- copy/paste image
- rename (optional)
- replace url in the src - './images/imageName.extension'
- './' because assets are on the same server

Disadvantages with this approach:
The assets in the public folder don't get optimized.
