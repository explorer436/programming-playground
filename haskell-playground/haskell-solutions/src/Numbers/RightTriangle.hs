module Numbers.RightTriangle where

{- |
 Here's a problem that combines tuples and list comprehensions: 
 Which right triangle that has integers for all sides and all sides equal to or smaller than 10 has a perimeter of 24?
 First, let's try generating all triangles with sides equal to or smaller than 10:

tupleTriangles = [ (a,b,c) | c <- [1..10], b <- [1..10], a <- [1..10] ] 
tupleRigtTriangles = [ (a,b,c) | c <- [1..10], b <- [1..c], a <- [1..b] , a^2 + b^2 == c^2 ]
tupleRigtTriangleWithPerimeter24 = [ (a,b,c) | c <- [1..10], b <- [1..c], a <- [1..b] , a^2 + b^2 == c^2 , a + b + c == 24]
-- [(6,8,10)]
