	/**
	 * The Stream.reduce Method :
	 * 
	 * The Stream.reduce method is a general-purpose reduction operation.
	 * 
	 * The reduce operation in this example takes two arguments:
	 * 
	 * 1. identity: 
	 *    The identity element is both the initial value of the reduction and the default result if there are no elements in the stream. 
	 *    In this example, the identity element is 0; 
	 *    this is the initial value of the sum of ages and the default value if no members exist in the collection people.
	 * 
	 * 2. accumulator: 
	 *    The accumulator function takes two parameters: 
	 *    a partial result of the reduction (in this example, the sum of all processed integers so far) and the next element of the stream (in this example, an integer). 
	 *    It returns a new partial result. 
	 *    In this example, the accumulator function is a lambda expression that adds two Integer values and returns an Integer value:
	 *    (a, b) -> a + b
	 * 
	 * The reduce operation always returns a new value. 
	 * However, the accumulator function also returns a new value every time it processes an element of a stream. 
	 * Suppose that you want to reduce the elements of a stream to a more complex object, such as a collection. 
	 * This might hinder the performance of your application. 
	 * 
	 * If your reduce operation involves adding elements to a collection, then every time your accumulator function processes an element, 
	 * it creates a new collection that includes the element, which is inefficient. 
	 * 
	 * It would be more efficient for you to update an existing collection instead. 
	 * You can do this with the Stream.collect method.
	 * 
	 * The difference between Stream.reduce and Stream.collect is that for collect, we need to pass a third argument called "combiner". 
	 * Stream.reduce does not need a "combiner".

	/**
	 * Question about Java 8 Streams - collect vs reduce
	 * 
	 * When would you use collect() vs reduce()? Does anyone have good, concrete examples of when it's definitely better to go one way or the other?
	 * Javadoc mentions that collect() is a mutable reduction.
	 * Given that it's a mutable reduction, I assume it requires synchronization (internally) which, in turn, can be detrimental to performance. 
	 * Presumably reduce() is more readily parallelizable at the cost of having to create a new data structure for return after every step in the reduce.
	 * The above statements are guesswork however and I'd love an expert to chime in here.
	 * 
	 * Answer : 
	 * "reduce" is a "fold" operation, it applies a binary operator to each element in the stream where 
	 * the first argument to the operator is the return value of the previous application and 
	 * the second argument is the current stream element.
	 * 
	 * "collect" is an aggregation operation where a "collection" is created and 
	 * each element is "added" to that collection. 
	 * Collections in different parts of the stream are then added together.
	 * 
	 * The document you linked (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#Reduction) gives the reason for having two different approaches:
	 * 
	 * If we wanted to take a stream of strings and concatenate them into a single long string, we could achieve this with ordinary reduction:
	 * 
	 * String concatenated = strings.reduce("", String::concat)  
	 * We would get the desired result, and it would even work in parallel. 
	 * However, we might not be happy about the performance! 
	 * Such an implementation would do a great deal of string copying, and the run time would be O(n^2) in the number of characters. 
	 * A more performant approach would be to accumulate the results into a StringBuilder, 
	 * which is a mutable container for accumulating strings. 
	 * We can use the same technique to parallelize mutable reduction as we do with ordinary reduction.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * So the point is that the parallelisation is the same in both cases but in the reduce case we apply the function to the stream elements themselves. 
	 * In the collect case we apply the function to a mutable container.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Another answer :
	 * The reason is simply that:
	 * collect() can only work with mutable result objects.
	 * reduce() is designed to work with immutable result objects.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Another explanation :
	 * Let the stream be a <- b <- c <- d
	 * In reduction, you will have ((a # b) # c) # d
	 * where # is that interesting operation that you would like to do.
	 * 
	 * In collection, your collector will have some kind of collecting structure K.
	 * K consumes a. K then consumes b. K then consumes c. K then consumes d.
	 * At the end, you ask K what the final result is.
	 * K then gives it to you.
	 *
