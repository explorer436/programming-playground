-- introduction to lists

-- In Haskell, lists are homogenous (stores same type of elements).

{- |
    In Haskell, strings are just a list of characters. 
    "hello" is just syntactic sugar for ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'].
    Because strings are lists, we can use list functions on them, which is really handy.
-}

{- |
    When you put together two lists (even if you append a singleton list to a list, 
    for instance: [1,2,3] ++ [4]), 
    internally, Haskell has to walk through the whole list on the left side of ++. 
    That's not a problem when dealing with lists that aren't too big. 
    But putting something at the end of a list that's fifty million entries long is going to take a while.  
-}

puttingTwoListsTogether l1 l2 = l1 ++ l2
testList1 = [1,2,3,4]
testList2 = [9,10,11,12]
testPuttingTwoListsTogether = puttingTwoListsTogether testList1 testList2
-- [1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12]

printHelloWorld = "hello" ++ " " ++ "world!"

printWoot = ['w','o'] ++ ['o','t']

{- |
 However, putting something at the beginning of a list using the : operator 
 (also called the cons operator - short for construct) is instantaneous. 
-}
consOperatorFirstSample = 'A':" small cat"
consOperatorSecondSample = 5:[1,2,3,4,5]

{- |
 The difference between ++ and the cons operator is, 
 ++ operates on lists and 
 cons operator operates on a single number (or character) 
 and a list of numbers (or characters).
 You might be tempted to try writing [1,2]:3 to 
 add an element to the end of a list, 
 but ghci will reject this with an error message, 
 because the first argument of (:) must be an element, 
 and the second must be a list.
-}
-- How to append an element at the end of a list in Haskell?
-- Not preferrable because Haskell has to 
-- walk through the whole list on the left side first.
testAppendingAnElementAtTheEndOfAList_01 = "hello" ++ ['b']
testAppendingAnElementAtTheEndOfAList_02 = [1,2,3] ++ [4]

{- |
[1, 2, 3] is just syntactic sugar for 1:2:3:[]
[] is an empty list.
So, 5:[1,2,3,4] is syntactic sugar for 5:1:2:3:4:[]

-- list of lists.
testListOfLists = [[3,2,1], [2,12,1,17], [3,10,100,72,365]]
-- list of list of lists.
testListOfListOfLists = [testListOfLists, [[1111], [2222]]]


-- list comparison
-- lists can be compared if the stuff they contain can be compared.
{- |
 hint: look up Lexicographical order in wikipedia
 They are compared in lexicographical order.
 If a result can be determined by just looking at the first elements, the subsequent elements are ignored.
-}
testListComparison_1 = [3,2,1] > [2,1,0]  -- true
testListComparison_2 = [3,2,1] > [2,10,100]  -- true because 3 > 2. Having found a result, the comparison stops here.
testListComparison_3 = [3,2,1] > [3,1,100]  -- false because 3 is not greater than 3
testListComparison_4 = [3,4,2] > [3,4]  -- true
testListComparison_5 = [3,4,2] > [2,4]  -- true
testListComparison_6 = [3,4,2] == [3,4,2]  -- true
testListComparison_7 = [2,12,1] > [3,10,100]  -- false
testListComparison_8 = [3] == [3]  -- true
testListComparison_9 = [3,4] == [3,5] -- false
testListComparison_10 = [3,4] > [3,5] -- true
testListComparison_11 = [3,4] < [3,5] -- false
{- |
 A nice example for when lexicographical ordering does not result in what the user would expect is 
 file names in Windows. 
 If you have files named xyz1.txt, xyz2.txt, xyz10.txt and xyz20.txt, 
 the lexicographical order would be: 
 xyz1.txt, xyz10.txt, xyz2.txt, xyz20.txt

The comparison does not stop at the first evaluation.
It continues evaluating until a decision can be made.
And a decision can be made as soon as there is an i so that a[i] and b[i] are not equal.
Otherwise the arrays are considered equal.
