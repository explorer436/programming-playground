What's the best way to implement multi threading in Java aside the usual Runnable interface or Thread base class?

I think it depends on why you need it:

If you just want to apply some transformation to lots of data, parallelStream in Java 8 is your friend - Parallelism (The Java™ Tutorials > Collections > Aggregate Operations) (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/parallelism.html)

If you want to have lots of different tasks in-flight, i.e. to speed up some GUI application, you can use futures (JVM concurrency: Java and Scala concurrency basics) or the new, better futures in Java 8 (JVM concurrency: Java 8 concurrency basics - https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jvmc2/index.html). The first link explains the differences to manual threads.

If you just want lots of asynchrony, i.e. for building networked GUI apps, there's FRP and RxJava (Grokking RxJava, Part 1: The Basics - https://blog.danlew.net/2014/09/15/grokking-rxjava-part-1/). There's also experimental support for parallel observables here - ReactiveX/RxJavaParallel (https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaParallel).
