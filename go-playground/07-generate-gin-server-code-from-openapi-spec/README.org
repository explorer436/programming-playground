* Steps for implementation

1. Write the openapi spec file

2. Generating code for gin server using oapi-codegen:

   #+begin_src
   (Don't use this)
    oapi-codegen -config server.cfg.gin.1.yaml openapi-ping.yaml

    or

    oapi-codegen -o ./api/generatedserver-albums-gin.go -config server.cfg.gin.2.yaml openapi-albums.yaml
   #+end_src

3. After the server code is generated, write the handlers

4. Write main.go and use the handlers

5. Testing:

   #+begin_src
   curl http://localhost:8080/my-custom-basepath/albums

   curl http://localhost:8080/albums \
       --include \
       --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --request "POST" \
       --data '{"id": "4","title": "The Modern Sound of Betty Carter","artist": "Betty Carter","price": 49.99}'

   curl http://localhost:8080/albums/2
   #+end_src

6. Request validation:

   #+begin_src
   [explorer436@explorer436-p50-20eqs27p03 programming-notes]$ curl -v http://localhost:8080/albums        --include        --header "Content-Type: application/json"        --req   uest "POST"        --data '{"id": "4","artist": "Betty Carter","price": 49.99}'
   Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.
