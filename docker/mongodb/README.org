* Setting up Mongodb container in docker:

I tried setting up a database and a user for it using the file ~docker-compose-with-mongo-and-mongo-express.yml~. But that approach did not work. Something seems to be going wrong while setting up users for the newly created database in mongodb.

So, I quit following that pattern and instead, I set up mongodb using the file ~docker-compose-with-mongodb.yml~.

To set-up containers using this docker-compose file, use the command: ~docker-compose -f docker-compose-with-mongo.yml up -d~
