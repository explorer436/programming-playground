Does studying CLRS really help in cracking the interviews with companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc?

Jordan Bishop · September 5 Conducted dozens of technical interviews.

Of course. CLRS is like an encyclopedia of data structures & algorithms knowledge, and it really is one of the best books you could use if you’re preparing for your technical interviews. It covers plenty of common and even some obscure topics, such as:

    Elementary data structures
    Hash tables
    Binary search trees
    Dynamic programming
    Minimum spanning trees
    Maximum flow
    Matrix operations
    Approximation algorithms
    Fibonacci heap
    Computational geometry

However, if your intention is to land a job at a big tech company like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, you’ll need to use more than just CLRS to do so. Here are a few reasons why:

    Not friendly to beginners on the topic: If you’re not familiar with data structures & algorithms to begin with, CLRS will be a long and painful read: you’ll need another resource to learn the basics first.
    Interviewers at FAANG companies aren’t expecting you to write perfect code: They’re also evaluating whether or not you can properly communicate what’s on your mind when you come up with a solution to their problem, and they’d like to see you discussing ways of optimizing your solution with them.
    It doesn’t cover systems design at all: Coding interviews usually have a systems design section as well, and that’s an aspect that CLRS doesn’t cover very well either. This forces you to use more than one resource to adequately prepare for your coding interviews.

If you feel that you could use more preliminary data structures & algorithms knowledge, you could use a book like Grokking Algorithms
, which is an illustrated book that will teach you the fundamentals of data structures & algorithms without delving into obscure math concepts and in the simplest format available. Once you have the fundamentals of DS&A down, you could use a site like LeetCode

as you read CLRS to give a practical application to your newfound knowledge with over 1,000 programming questions similar to the ones you can expect from Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.

On the other hand, if you’re looking for a resource to learn systems design, you may want to try enrolling in a course like Tech Interview Pro

. TIP was designed by a former Google software engineer and has two entire modules on systems design (one basic, one advanced) covering topics such as load balancing, caching, CDNs, databases, redundancy and replication, database sharding, and API design. It also has Q&A sessions with the course’s founder every two weeks.

If you’d like to practice non-technical aspects of the interview such as your communication skills, you’ll want to use a resource like Interviewing.io

, where you can take part in mock interviews (done by other software engineers, some of whom have worked at Facebook and Google) while you receive immediate, objective feedback on your performance.

Good luck with your interviews.
