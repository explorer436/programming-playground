Pre-requisities

Serious Haskell projects (not textbook problems) are memory-guzzlers during development & compilation. 
So, it won’t be long before your system starts swapping, which is why it’s better to have an SSD along with a lot of RAM. 
For serious Haskell development, we recommend at least 10 GB of RAM and at least 256 GB SSD. 
For text-book practice, you can probably get away with 4GB of RAM and an HDD.
