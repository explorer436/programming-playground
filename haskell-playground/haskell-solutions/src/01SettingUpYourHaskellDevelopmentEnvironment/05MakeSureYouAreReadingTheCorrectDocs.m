Make sure you are reading the correct docs

You will find yourself referring to API documentation very often. However, do not search for the package names on Google and start reading docs from there. You will end-up in a world of pain without even realising it. Google doesn’t know which version of the package you’re using, and from a first-hand experience, things change a lot between versions.

So, here’s what you should do:

Check which LTS/resolver you are on – it’ll be the very first setting in your project’s stack.yaml file.
Go to the Stackage homepage (https://www.stackage.org/) and find the listing page for your LTS/resolver. For example, here’s the listing for lts-9.17 (https://www.stackage.org/lts-9.17)
Search for documentation and packages only from this page
