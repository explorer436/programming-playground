* springboot jpa

A sample project that uses h2 for database.


Run Spring Boot application with command: mvn spring-boot:run
Let’s open H2 console with url: http://localhost:8080/h2-ui

When you login to the console, you should see the tables created for the entities defined in the application.

** Inventory package

This shows how to write tests that interact with the h2 database instead of using mocking.
