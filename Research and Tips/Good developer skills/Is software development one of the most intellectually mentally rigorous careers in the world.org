Is software development one of the most intellectually/mentally rigorous careers in the world?

“Rigorous”? Sadly, no. The late Gerald (Jerry) Weinberg, about 40–50 years ago, made this observation:

If architects built buildings the way that programmers build software, the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.

A bit of hyperbole, but still far too close to reality for comfort. And things haven’t improved nearly enough in the intervening decades.

Now, software development done right is a highly demanding discipline, given the amount of trial-and-error investigation and invention required, the astronomical state space that can occur within a given system, and the challenges of maintaining conceptual unity and consistency when you have multiple developers all working on the same piece of software. But all too often those in management are more focused on saving money and shipping early. And, bluntly, there are a lot of people working as developers who really aren’t capable or qualified.

I’m surprised (but delighted) that this has gotten more upvotes than anything else I’ve posted to date, especially since it was a brief, somewhat flippant response. :-)

Anyone interested in more of my thoughts on software development can check out the website for the CS 428 (‘real-world software engineering’) class: http://cs428.cs.byu.edu/

that I’ve been teaching at Brigham Young University for four years now.

Here are some of my articles and webposts that I have my students read (along with some great video podcasts by my colleague Dr. Charles Knutson):

And here are videos of lectures (with accompanying slides) from prior semesters:

For legal/privacy reasons, I can’t post this semester’s Zoom recordings.

And finally, here’s a list of books I strongly recommend for anyone working in the software engineering field:
