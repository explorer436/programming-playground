Why is Java losing popularity?

Java came into the world with a number of bold promises:

    universal support (write once, run everywhere, no fine print)
    performance similar to native implementations like C/C++
    easier to learn than C++
    an industry backed alternative to an emerging Microsoft centric world.

It has pretty much delivered in all of the above for a while until all those pillars started crumbling:

    Universal support:
        it lost the in-browser battle early on to javascript
        it never quite deliver rich enough desktop experience (with few notable exceptions) to become a top choice for desktop application development
        Apple has actively discouraged its use in OSX and there is no reasonable way to doing java iOS development
        It is an Android supported language, and that would have been a big java revival moment, EXCEPT that the fraught relation between Oracle and Google, has made Google less bullish in promoting it as the language of choice.
    Performance-wise, it can be about as fast as native options except for places where one really gets down to the wire (HFT, HCP etc.) and there C/C++ approaches still have an edge.
    It is still easier to use than C/C++, but it has fallen behind modern languages on many fronts (while .net, C++ and even JS have made significant strides). At this point, where performance matters, modern C++ is the clearer option (tighter code, better end results) and where it’s less of an issue, python and others are much better candidates for concise and rapid prototyping.
    We are no longer in the Microsoft centric world that motivated many to embrace java as a hedge against it, all major corporate backers of java (Sun, IBM etc.) are dead or irrelevant, Oracle and Google don’t seem very committed to push java into the 2020s.

It’s still my “go to” language for taking hacker-rank tests, I am sure it will be around to the decades to come but its better days are likely gone.
