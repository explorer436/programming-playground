Hey there,

A new user just asked for the back story behind Daily Coding Problem, so I thought I would share it with you as well.

A while back, my friends were practicing for coding interviews, and I started a group chat where we tried to solve a coding problem every day.

It worked insanely well — all of them got offers from top tech companies and startups.

Fast forward, I started Daily Coding Problem with a buddy. The original website was ridiculously hideous.

Daily Coding Problem is like that group chat, trying to solve a coding interview question together. What I love is that with consistent practice, you get much faster and better at coming up with solutions.

We've found that working on the same problems with your friends helps a lot with motivation. Just send them this link — https://www.dailycodingproblem.com — and tell them to subscribe. With daily practice, I’m sure you’ll land that dream job offer. Good luck and happy studying!
